Fix tab activation bug after closing another tabs without
switching to them (for example clicking on another tab's close
button). We should remove the widget from container's stack before
removing it from the tabbar, tabbar activates new widget by its
index, and if the old one is still in stack, then indices are off
by one. For me this also fixes the crash in ctrl-tab document
switcher (which probably got activation signal of the view which
was already deleted). BUG:204383<br><br>
