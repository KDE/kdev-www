<H4>Linux Format Award 2001</H4>
Richard Smedley (Production Editor, Linux Format) said:<br>
"Linux Format is the UK's largest (oldest, best-selling, etc...  [;-)] 
GNU/Linux magazine, with considerable sales across Scandinavia,
Benelux, Australia and the USA. At the beginning of the year
readers voted on which nominations to put up for each
category on the site (<a href="http://www.linuxformat.co.uk">www.linuxformat.co.uk</a>), after the
nominations were decided they were announced in the magazine
and on the site, and votes were sent in.

The story isn't on the front page of the site, but
in due course the magazine article will appear in
our online archives ...
I'll send it (the award) to Mirko Boehm at KDE e.V"<br><br>
