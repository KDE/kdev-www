<?php module_head("How To Join The KDevelop Team"); ?>
There's no reason to grumble about bugs and missing things. KDevelop can only be as good as you help to improve it.<br>
So <b>we need you!</b> Our team always looks for good Qt or KDE programmers.<br>
<br><br>
So what is to do to become a team member?:
<ul>
<li>have an idea what is annoying, bad or missing in KDevelop and have the will to implement that.</li>
<li><a href="index.html?filename=HEAD/branches_compiling.html">get the sources of kdevelop from SVN</a></li>
<li>compile yourself everything as debug version to be able to backtrace crashes</li>
<li>study the kdevelop source code, debug KDevelop itself and watch the running backtraces to understand the mechanisms; recognize the important and unimportant C++-classes in the project</li>
<li>patch the current sources</li>
<li>create a patch file (*.diff) against the current cvs version</li>
<li>Send it to <a href="index.html?filename=mailinglist.html">kdevelop-devel at kdevelop.org</a></li>
<li>get response, flaming and love</li>
<li>write more such cool patches and bother the mailing-list again with it</li>
<li>learn the <a href="http://developer.kde.org/policies/commitpolicy.html">SVN commit policies</a></li>
<li>get an own kdevelop-cvs account, and maybe a yourname at kdevelop.org address to be able to commit your stuff by yourself</li>
<li>...</li>
<li>*years of becoming a long staying team member* (seeing the people, patches and versions come and go)</li>
<li>...</li>
<li>become a KDevelop guru</li>
<li>...</li>
<li>become rich due thousands of fan gifts and donated stuff... ;-)</li>
<li>...</li>
<li>KDevelop-20.5.134 release</li>
<li>...</li>
<li>The End.</li>
</ul>
