<h2>Binary snapshot of the stable KDevelop with a critical bugfix</h2><p>
It seams that the official KDevelop 3.5.1 release had a critical bug:
<a href="http://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=158236">
Compiler errors were not shown in output window</a>.
But thanks to an user that posted <b>reproducible steps</b> on how to trigger the bug,
the KDevelop team was able to fix it and release
<a href="index.html?filename=3.5/download.html">
binary packages with the fix</a> within hours of the bug report.
This proves that <b>reporting bugs correctly</b>, allows us to <b>fix them faster</b>.
