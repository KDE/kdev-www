<h2>Website improvments</h2><p>
During the month of January the website was converted from HTML 4.01 Transitional to
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/">HTML 4.01 strict</a>
and the content got separated from the presentation which is now exclusively done in
<a href="http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/">CSS</a>.
Tables are no longer used to create the website layout; so it now renders progressively with the main content served before the navigational elements being therefore faster, this also allows people with disabilities to visit our site now.
The new structure is more search-engine friendly, and
<a href="http://www.sitemaps.org/">website maps for search engine robots</a>
are now created daily so the current 1627 unique pages of this site and the 84 unique pages of it's wiki get indexed only when they change, allowing more frequent and precise crawls, at the same time reducing wasted bandwidth (unmodified pages do not get crawled).
The 7841 posts of the
<a href="phorum5/">forum</a>
are not yet indexed by the search-engines because their information flows into the FAQ, wiki and user-manual pages, and this saves bandwidth.
This website contains 500033 html links, all of them were checked with
<a href="http://linkchecker.sourceforge.net/">linkchecker</a>
and only a few of them (&lt; 100) are broken, mostly links published more that four years ago. Enjoy, Amilcar Lucas.
