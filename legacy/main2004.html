<b>06. March 2004</b> - Big web site re-design.
The website plays a big part in <a href="HEAD/doc/api/html/architecture.html#devteammodel">KDevelop's development infrastructure</a>.
The main objective was to allow having version dependent webpages.
This makes it possible to present information about the <a href="index.html?filename=3.0/kdevelop.html">stable</a>
(3.0.x) and development (HEAD) versions of KDevelop.<br>
This had many <i>side effects</i>:
resurrected information on the old <a href="index.html?filename=1.3/kdevelop.html">KDevelop-1.x</a>,
<a href="http://www.w3.org/">W3C</a> HTML compliancy, fixed broken links, used more CSS,
users can choose one of four CSS, google website search and last but not least, a new look.
Hope you like it - Amilcar Lucas.<br>
