<h1>Forbidden</h1>

<h2>You are a bad robot!</h2>
<p> This might have been caused by different things, such as any of the following:</p>
<ol>
<li> You tried to brute force attack KDevelop.org by inventing non existing or invalid URLs.</li>
<li> You did not follow the <CODE>robots.txt</CODE> rules.</li>
<li> You did not follow the <CODE>&#060;meta name="robots" content="..."&#062;</CODE> rules.</li>
<li> You did not identify yourself as being a robot. You impersonated Mozilla, IE or firefox although you are a robot.</li>
</ol>

<?php sleep(3); ?>

<p>If you have misbehaved too many times your access to KDevelop.org will be <b>forbidden forever</b>, otherwise just for the next eight minutes. So do <b>not</b> try to access this page too many times on a row.</p> 

<p>In case you are a <b>legitimate human user interested in KDevelop</b> using a <b>normal browser</b> then we apologize for
this inconvenience, but like you, we enjoy our privacy, so we have a right to block automated e-mail harvesters, unpolite
mirroring tools and automated guestbook posters.
To be removed from the <em>bad robots blacklist</em> you can send an e-mail to this
<a href="http://spamassassin.apache.org/">
spamassassin protected</a> e-mail <em>webmaster&nbsp;&nbsp;kdevelop.org</em> with your IP address
(<?php if (isset($HTTP_SERVER_VARS['REMOTE_ADDR'])) echo $HTTP_SERVER_VARS['REMOTE_ADDR']; ?>)
explaining why you find KDevelop such a great tool ;) .</p>
