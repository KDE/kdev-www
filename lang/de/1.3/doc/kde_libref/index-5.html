<H3><A NAME="s5">5. User Control Elements</A></H3>

<P>
<P>
<H3><A NAME="The Menubar"></A> <A NAME="ss5.1">5.1 The Menubar</A>
</H3>

<P>The menu bar is a central component of the main window. It allows the user to execute operations that the application (or to be precise:
the mainview) offers in regards of manipulating the main view's contents. In opposition to Qt's <CODE>QMenuBar</CODE>, KDE offers the use of
the class <CODE>KMenuBar</CODE>. Additionally, the menu bar is already constructed for the programmer when using <CODE>KTMainWindow</CODE> with the
first call of <CODE>menuBar()</CODE>.
<P>The menu bar itself, independent which class is going to be used, contains entries that the user can select with the mouse or by using
keyboard accelerators with the ALT-key and the underlined character. The menus that have to pop up on a selection have to be created
with the class <CODE>QPopupMenu</CODE>, which itself only provides the popups, entries have to be inserted using the methods provided by
<CODE>QMenuData</CODE>.
<P>Mind that menu-bars should always contain all functions a program has to offer except those that can be accessed by additional dialogs.
The menu bar also makes use of the <CODE>KApplication</CODE> help menu already provided. Inserting the menu is just easy with
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
menuBar()->insertItem(i18n("Help"), kapp->getHelpMenu());
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Example construction of a menu bar with using <CODE>KTMainWindow</CODE> and setting the menu bar explicitely:
<HR>
<PRE>
my_menubar=new KMenuBar(this,"my_menubar");

file_menu = new QPopupMenu;
file_menu->insertItem(Icon("filenew.xpm"),i18n("&amp;New..."),
                      this,SLOT(slotFileNew()),0,ID_FILE_NEW);
file_menu->insertItem(Icon("open.xpm"),i18n("&amp;Open..."),
                      this, SLOT(slotFileOpen()),0 ,ID_FILE_OPEN);
file_menu->insertItem(i18n("&amp;Close"),
                      this, SLOT(slotFileClose()),0,ID_FILE_CLOSE);
file_menu->insertSeparator();
file_menu->insertItem(Icon("save.xpm"),i18n("&amp;Save"),
                      this, SLOT(slotFileSave()),0 ,ID_FILE_SAVE);
file_menu->insertItem(i18n("Save &amp;As..."),
                      this, SLOT(slotFileSaveAs()),0 ,ID_FILE_SAVE_AS);
file_menu->insertItem(Icon("save_all.xpm"),i18n("Save All"),
                      this, SLOT(slotFileSaveAll()),0,ID_FILE_SAVE_ALL);
file_menu->insertSeparator();
file_menu->insertItem(Icon("fileprint.xpm"),i18n("&amp;Print..."),
                      this, SLOT(slotFilePrint()),0 ,ID_FILE_PRINT);
file_menu->insertSeparator();
file_menu->insertItem(i18n("E&amp;xit"),
                      this, SLOT(slotFileQuit()),0 ,ID_FILE_QUIT);

my_menubar->insertItem(i18n("&amp;File"), file_menu);

setMenu(my_menubar);
</PRE>
<HR>
<P>The example creates a menu bar and a popup menu first. Then the popup menu is filled with entries. The used method of <CODE>QMenuData</CODE>
here allows an implicit connection to the method to call when the popup menu emits SIGNAL(activated(int)). The zero parameters after
the slot declaration is left out as the example assumes the program will use <CODE>KAccel</CODE> to set the according keyboard accelerators
with <CODE>changeMenuAccel()</CODE>. Further you can see that the integer value ID is inserted like the method name with all uppercase letters
and underscores to separate the words. The menu id's themselves are set with #define in a separate file to keep track of the used
numbers. You would think that you don't need the menu id if the <CODE>activated()</CODE> signal is already connected - in fact the id can be
used to forward the signal <CODE>highlighted(int)</CODE> to a method that compares the id by a switch statement and sets a statusbar
help message for the menu entry. You could as well do that for the signal <CODE>activated(int)</CODE> as well to call the according method by a
switch statement. Then you have to add a <CODE>connect()</CODE> for each popup menu you want to use.
<P>You can as well insert a separator into the menu bar with <CODE>my_menubar->insertSeparator()</CODE>. This will align all entries inserted after
the separator to the right in Motif style, in windows style this has no effect.
<P>The creation of a separate menu bar allows the creation of several menubars which can be set as the actual menu with <CODE>setMenu()</CODE>.
This is how we did it in KDevelop to change the menu bar when switching to the dialogeditor and back to the project editor.
<P>Finally, the ampersand in the menu entry sets the following character as the keyboard accelerator when the user presses ALT+ the
character.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="ss5.2">5.2 The Toolbar</A>
</H3>

<P>
<P>Toolbars are another component that enhance user interaction with symbols representing most needed functions that an application
provides. The KDE libraries are again offering another class to use with KDE applications, <CODE>KToolBar</CODE>. As <CODE>KTMainWindow</CODE> already
handles the geometry management for all user interface elements, it also provides methods to add toolbars. Now, the good thing is that
you can use as many toolbars as your application may require and the creation is done easily with <CODE>toolBar()</CODE>. This method also
takes a parameter which is the according toolbarnumber. The first toolbar has by default number 0, so the parameter can be left out
there; the next has to be called with <CODE>toolBar(1)</CODE> etc. You can also make this more variable with a define for your toolbar and use
a descriptive name; this avoids changing the toolbarnumber everywhere when you decide to set a toolbar to another position.
<P>Now, when using a toolbar, you have many choices. The class <CODE>KToolBar</CODE> provides a whole set of methods to insert user elements such
as buttons, which is probably the most recently used method, delayed popups, lineedits, combos and generally a widget of your choice.
Further you need to know that toolbars are created with using the full width of the parent window - but that is configurable. All
following toolbars are then appended to the end of the last toolbar. Also you can set the toolbar to show at a certain position. This
is often used by applications that offer painting facilities. The following example shows you how to use a toolbar with
<CODE>KTMainWindow</CODE>:
<P>
<HR>
<PRE>
1   // first call of toolBar() - creates the toolbar 0.
2   toolBar()->insertButton(Icon("new.xpm"), ID_FILE_NEW, true, i18n("New File"));

3   QPopupMenu* select_menu = new QPopupMenu();
4   toolBar()->insertButton(Icon("select.xpm"), ID_OPTIONS_SELECT, select_menu, true, i18n("Select Option"));

5   connect(toolBar(), SIGNAL(clicked( int )), SLOT( slotSelected( int )) );


6   Foo::slotSelected( int id ){

7     switch (id ){

8       case ID_FILE_NEW:
9         slotFileNew();
10        break;
11    }
12  }
</PRE>
<HR>

The above explains some specialities for toolbars - we will discuss these now in detail. First of all, you see that we used the
<CODE>toolBar()</CODE> method. This returns a pointer to the according toolbar and creates one if the toolbar doesn't exist. We use the
<CODE>insertButton()</CODE> method to add a toolbar button representing the standard "New File" action. Now, when looking at the
class-documentation of <CODE>KToolBar</CODE>, you see that there is a <CODE>QPixmap</CODE> required as the first parameter. Here, we only set the name
of the pixmap embraced by the <CODE>Icon()</CODE> method. This is a macro which makes inserting icons very easy, provided by <CODE>kapp.h</CODE>. In
fact, it makes the application's <CODE>KIconLoader</CODE> instance load the icon with the filename <CODE>new.xpm</CODE> for you using a list of
standard directories within the KDE File System. Additionally, the icon <CODE>new.xpm</CODE> is already provided - you don't have to paint it
yourself. The KDE libraries come with a whole set of toolbar icons that are ready to use for insertion. This is also the reason why,
when testing an application, sometimes a button looks a bit scrambled although you have painted the pixmap - it just can't be found if
it isn't installed at the correct location within the KDE FSSTD; whereas standard icons are already present.
<P>The exact execution of the <CODE>Icon()</CODE> macro is therefore:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
KApplication::getKApplication()->getIconLoader()->loadIcon("new.xpm")
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>In KDE2, you have to use BarIcon() to load menu/toolbar icons</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>which implicitely uses the <CODE>kapp</CODE> macro to get the application object. You see that using this macro saves lots of code but offers a
very nice way to load an icon for a toolbar button.
<P>The second parameter, the ID of the button, is a macro that our application specifies itself to name certain actions logically by a
#define. Obviously, you could think that using another method of <CODE>KToolBar</CODE> would do the same when directly specifying the receiver
object and the slot to call, but this way you save a lot of code. The first place is that you only have to write one <CODE>connect()</CODE>
(line 5) to connect all toolbar elements. The other is, that by this way you can use the same ID for your toolbar items as well as for
your menubar items. The following code completes this example with the according menubar action:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
QPopupMenu* file_menu = new QPopupMenu();
file_menu->insertItem(Icon("filenew.xpm"),i18n("&amp;New..."),0,ID_FILE_NEW);

connect(file_menu, SIGNAL(activated(int)), SLOT(slotSelected(int)));

menuBar()->insertItem(file_menu, i18n("&amp;File"));
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>By this, the <CODE>file_menu</CODE> is already connected to the <CODE>slotSelected()</CODE> method and the corresponding entry "New File" executes the
same action. Just collect all your ID's as #defines into one file and you can keep a good overview over the used numbers (which
naturally have to be integer values).
<P>The next example in line 3 and 4 add a button that opens a popup menu when the user presses the button. This can be used if the button
itself does not perform any action but represents a better access method for e.g. a list of entries. Just create your popup menu and
insert it with the according ID and pointer as a button.
<P>Besides the example you can do a lot of other things like making a button a toggle button. This is useful if the button executes an
on/off action (which in the corresponding menubar popup is represented by a checkmark). See the complete reference of <CODE>KToolBar</CODE> for
more information.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="ss5.3">5.3 The Statusbar</A>
</H3>

<P>KDE also provides the pendant to Qt's <CODE>QStatusBar</CODE>, <CODE>KStatusBar</CODE>. The statusbar can contain labels
as well as widgets, such as progress bars (those have to have the statusbar as parent). The statusbar is used to display information
about the current state of the application and gives hints about the usage of commands e.g. over toolbars and menubars.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="Keyboard Accelerators"></A> <A NAME="ss5.4">5.4 Keyboard Accelerators</A>
</H3>

<P>Keyboard accelerators are a good enhancement for any kind of application. GUI application designers often think that the user can
access all methods with the provided graphical interface, but advanced users usually want to work as fast as possible and using the
mouse to call actions doesn't make an application very attractive. The more a user will make use of your application, the more he will
miss keyboard accelerators. Fortunately, the Qt and KDE libraries provide a whole set of functions and classes to support keyboard
accelerators in conjunction with GUI elements. This section therefore collects all these classes and shows the possible implememtation
for various situations.
<P>
<H4>Menu Accelerators</H4>

<P>The first thing where keyboard accelerators are used without much effort from the programmer's side is over menuentries. The menubar,
as mentioned above, consists of a set of <CODE>QPopupMenu</CODE>s, which are inserted in the order they will appear later from left to right.
The popup menu itself can be called by the user by a keyboard shortcut if he presses the ALT-key together with the underlined character
of the desired menu of the menubar. The menuentry itself has to define the underlined character at the time you insert the popup into
the menubar.
<P>Example:
<P>
<PRE>
menuBar()->insertItem(i18n("&amp;File"), file_menu);
</PRE>
<P>Mind the ampersand in front of "File". This makes the "F" the key with which the user can pop up the popup menu <CODE>file_menu</CODE> when
pressed together with the ALT-key. The same goes with entries within the popups, where the user, after a popup is active, only has to
press the key to invoke the desired action. Selfexplaining, you should watch the usage of underlined characters very closely, because a
key that is used twice either in the menubar or within the same popup makes the last inserted item the one that is activated and this
makes the previously defined shortcuts useless.
<P>Using the menu-accelerators is therefore very easy for the programmer - just select the key you want to be used and set an ampersand
in front of it while inserting the entry. As the KDE applications get internationalized, translators take over the responsibility to
place the keys in their translated version later. They should watch the same principles for placing the keys and shouldn't only
translate one-to-one but test the application later if everything is accessible again by their keyboard shortcuts.
<P>
<H4>Tabulator and Button Accelerators</H4>

<P>
<P>The keyboard accelerators with the ALT-key don't only work with the menus - they do the same over dialogs, tab-pages and on buttons.
Therefore it should be used whereever possible, the principle is the same: on a dialog, you have to watch the used keys, on e.g. a
<CODE>QTabDialog</CODE> you have to watch the keys for each page <B>plus</B> the used keys to activate the pages in the <CODE>addTab()</CODE> methods.
<P>Within the user interface, buttons have an additional option - as mentionend, the keyboard input focus is forwarded in user interfaces
with the TAB and SHIFT-TAB keys. When a button receives the focus, it gets a slight frame like other active elements, the user has to
press the SPACE-key to execute the action connected to the button. Now, this can be changed by using <CODE>setDefault(true)</CODE> on one
button or by setting <CODE>setAutoDefault(true)</CODE> on several buttons on the dialog. The difference is that if the User presses the
ENTER-key, the default button will be pressed. If several buttons shall provide this behavoir, <CODE>setAutoDefault()</CODE> has to be used on
those. If one of them receives the keyboard input focus, it will automatically become the default button.
<P>
<P>KKeyDialog: keyboard accelerator configuration dialog
KKeyChooser
KAccel
<P>
<H3><A NAME="ss5.5">5.5 Other Widgets</A>
</H3>

<P>Control elements are used within visible areas of the application and can be combined together to create a dialog or view. Beyond the
control elements that the Qt library provides, KDE offers:
<P>KButton: active raise-lower button
KButtonBox: manages buttons
KColorButton: button displaying a color setting
KIconLoaderButton: button displaying a selected Icon
KCombo: similar to QComboBox
KDatePicker: Date selection widget
KIntegerLine: lineedit that only accepts integer values
KLedLamp: LED lamp
KLined: line edit
KPanner: panner devider
KNewPanner: panner devider managing two widgets
KPopupMenu: popup menu with title
KRestrictedLine: lineedit that only accepts certain input
KSelector: value selector
KSeparator: standard separator
KSlider: slider widget
KTabCtl: tabulator widget
