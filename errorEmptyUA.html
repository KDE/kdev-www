<h1>Precondition Failed</h1>

<p>The software that you used to access this site used an empty <em>User Agent</em> string, that means
that it did not identify itself.
This is usually a sign of automated e-mail harvesters, unpolite mirroring tools and automated guestbook posters.</p>

<p>In case you are a <b>legitimate human user interested in KDevelop</b> using a <b>normal browser</b> (one that
sends it's <em>User Agent</em> string) then we apologize for this inconvenience, but like you, we enjoy our privacy,
therefore we ask you to configure your browser software correctly.
If you can not configure it, try using a different Web browser, such as
<a href="http://www.spreadfirefox.com/">Firefox</a>.</p>

<p>Non compliance with this rule will get you <u>banned</u> (blocked) from this website.</p>
