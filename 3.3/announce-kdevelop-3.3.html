<H3 ALIGN="center">KDevelop <?php echo $k_base_version; ?> release Announcement</H3>
<P><STRONG>The KDevelop Team Ships Major Feature Release of Award-Winning Open Source IDE</STRONG></P>
<P>November 29, 2005 (The INTERNET).
The KDevelop Team is proud to ship KDevelop <?php echo $k_base_version; ?>, the fourth major release of this award-winning Integrated Development Environment (IDE).
</P>
<P>
"Over 30 developers contributed over a timespan of seven months to the project. The userbase has been growing steadily, the average download of 20 times per hour is a prof of it, and that gave us lots of inputs on how to improve the program. We also got new developers that brought new and fresh ideas" noted Amilcar do Carmo Lucas, release co-coordinator.
</P>

<H4>Major Enhancements</H4>
<P>
The main focus of this release was the improvement of the integrated debugger and the new QT4 support.
</P><P>
KDevelop supports over 15 programming languages and numerous version control systems, debuggers, documentation formats and build tools. Any Editor supporting the KTextEditor interfaces can be used as native KDevelop editor, including Kate, QEditor and Yzis. Build tools like automake, qmake and ant are supported natively, meaning that KDevelop does not maintain its own object repository. Changes in the native project files will be reflected in KDevelop and vice-versa. 
</P><P>
It offers a class view showing all the symbols either flat or hierarchical by namespaces and allows easy code-navigation. A background parser updates the symbols on the fly and also shows syntactical errors in the source code. The code completion even deals with external libraries and Qt signals and slots. 
</P><P>
With its open architecture, KDevelop can be customized and extended in every respect. The core IDE functionality has been moved to a set of libraries called "KDevelop platform", and these can be used as a foundation for new IDEs. The user interface can be switched  from classic MDI mode to the modern IDEAl mode, featuring a code-centric approach with on-demand tool-views. 
</P><P>
KDevelop features extensive support for navigating the source code. Symbols and filenames can be accessed by just typing part of the name, recently modified files can be reached with a simple keystroke. 
</P><P>
KDevelop offers documentation generators, code debugging, memory checking, code refactoring, bookmark management, and dozens of tools to make development easy and convenient. It is translated into more than 17 languages.
