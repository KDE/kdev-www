   KDevelop 1.1 - The Unix/Linux Development Environment - released 
   CeBIT 2000--Hannover, Germany, February 28, 2000
 
   1. Introduction 

   KDevelop 1.1 (http://www.kdevelop.org) is the official release for KDE 1.x systems. 
   Since the last release we added many new features like an internal debugger and 
   improved the current codebase. Beside that, we can now provide better support for 
   different Unix systems. The IDE proved its stability in real testing by programmers, 
   who created many new applications with previous versions of KDevelop. 

   This version is intended to be the last release for KDE 1.1.2. We want to concentrate 
   our effort now for KDevelop 2.x (which will work on KDE 2.x).

   2. Intention 

   The main reason for the creation of KDevelop was the lack of a modern,
   competitive solution for application development. Although Unix systems provide
   the user with a good and stable environment, including the X Window Sytem,
   modern tools available under other operating systems are missing. 

   Whereas hard-core Unix-developers state that Emacs and vi are the ultimate
   solution, KDE provides developers with a complete application framework
   together with the Qt library. The fact of the commercial availability of Qt also
   gets the interest of commercial development parties. Therefore the KDevelop
   project wants to 

      a.provide a code-writing environment for free 
      b.ease the use of standard development tools such as autoconf and
        automake 
      c.offer a graphical dialogeditor that reduces GUI design cycles 
      d.provide developers with direct, uncomplicated access to documentation
        written by the team or by third parties. This includes documentation for
        the KDE and QT APIs. 

   3. Overview 

   The KDevelop IDE provides the following tools for C/C++ application
   development: 

      a.a wizard-based projectgenerator that builds configurable frameworks for
        various application types (KDE1,KDE2,OpenGL(tm),terminal based...)
      b.a coding environment including: 
            a syntax-highlighting editor 
            a class browser and viewer 
            various file viewers 
            a internal debugger
      c.a documentation system for direct access to HTML-online
        documentation, including 5 handbooks for KDE/Qt development and fast
        search 
      d.a dialogeditor that fits the need for rapid construction of user interfaces,
        embedded completely into the development environment 
      e.works with the mime-type of files to start automagically the appropriate
        application inside KDevelop, like KIconEdit for bitmaps or KDbg for
        executables 
      f.CVS support for project development 
      g.support for uncomplicated localization of projects 
      h.translation into 17 languages 
      i.many additional features such as autosaving, commandline-passing etc. 

   This enables programmers to reduce development cycles to a minimum, while it
   offers the flexibility to work as they want at the same time. 

   We like to mention that although KDevelop requires KDE and Qt to work, you
   can as well use it for any other C++ project. It's designed as a C/C++
   development environment in the first place. 

   4. Why to use KDevelop 

   Every developer will ask if KDevelop can be better than Emacs, better than MS
   Visual Studio, better than Borland. The fact, that KDevelop provides a complete,
   user friendly interface, is mostly not regarded. 

   But we do not think we have to step back behind a long-term development of
   e.g. Emacs. Actually KDevelop is being developed with beta versions of
   KDevelop. In our own interest, stability was and is the main goal. You can expect
   KDevelop to do what you want it to do, it will stay stable, as far as we can
   consider by user reports of prior development versions. 

   The features were designed during the need of them for our own purposes. The
   programmer can expect that his environment interacts with him intuitively and in
   a fast and friendly way. 

   All features are well documented as well as we provide a whole set of
   handbooks for giving KDE primers a seamless start from wherever they may
   come from. 


   5. The Future 

   As KDE is stepping towards new technologies, the KDevelop project keeps up
   with the time. Besides the final work on KDevelop 1.1, we already proceeded
   towards version 2.0 that will support KDE 2 and future versions of the Qt library.
   So stay tuned ! 

   6. About the Team 

   The KDevelop Project, started in summer 1998, aims to provide developers with
   a good, stable and useful environment which can compete with modern IDEs.
   Since the beginning of the development, the team has grown from three
   members of the core team to eight codewriters and a translation team with over
   50 people. In the meantime, a lot of beta-testers have joined and shared their
   experience to improve KDevelop in stability and functionality.
