<H3><A NAME="Working with the Editor"></A> <A NAME="s7">7. Working with the Editor</A></H3>

<P>An important part of the integrated development environment is the editor. You're using it for:
<UL>
<LI>creating, opening and saving source and project files</LI>
<LI>editing source and project files</LI>
<LI>writing your SGML documentation</LI>
<LI>printing your project files</LI>
</UL>

Generally, the editor itself doesn't do much difference in comparison to other editors; especially as it is a build-in version of
the popular KWrite, also known as the "Extended Editor". If you're familiar with that, you won't have any problems using it for
managing your projects. In addition to normal editors, KDevelop contains a new printing system, that is far more extended for use
with sourcecodes- and you can choose between the printing program you want to use.
<P>This section gives you more information about how to handle your project files and to make you more familiar with the editor's
functionality. A lot of Unix-hardliners would prefer using Emacs or XEmacs- they're fine with that. But it isn't necessary for
easy programming, and especially for beginners, to work themselves into powerful editors which shall, in the result, only allow
you to enter your code.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="ss7.1">7.1 Managing Project Files</A>
</H3>

<P>The following sections describe how to create, save, open and close your project files you need to edit- mind that this doesn't
include translation files or pixmaps. Those are recognized automatically and the according editing program like KTranslator opens
those files for you.
<P>To give you an easy access to your files, KDevelop contains two easy-to-handle tree-views, similar to a filemanager, that recognize
if you selected a file, and opens it in the according editor window. The main view contains two windows that are used
independently, but connected via the Project Editor, so you can do all menubar actions the same way. The intention behind this is
that it allows you to handle two windows at the same time, although only one is visible. The C/C++ window thereby takes another
task, which allows you to easily compile your sources one by one, so you can check the implementations without having to run a
complete build-process over your project.
<P>This can be done when having the C/C++ window on top. Select "Compile File" from the Build-menu or press the according button in
the toolbar. Your file gets saved and compiled, and you can control any errors by the Compiler output in the output window.
<P>Within the IDE you can open as many text files as you like. All opened files are listed in the Window-menu, so you can switch
between them by selecting the according filename from the menu. Further, the actual opened file is displayed with its name in the
window frame of KDevelop.
<P>
<H4>Creating and Saving Files</H4>

<P>To create a new file, choose "New" from the File-menu. This opens the "New File" dialog, where you can specify the filename and type.
Additionally, you have to set the destination directory as well if the file is added to the project or not. Finally, you can also use
your header template for the project in case you want to add a new sourcefile without generating a new class by the Class-Generator.
<P>After the file has been created, you can edit the new file as usual; if you have to switch between different files, you can always
turn back to the file either via the file-trees or by the Window-menu.
<P>For saving any changes, KDevelop offers a whole variety of options. The standard way would be to save the file by selecting "Save"
or "Save As" from the File-menu or by the Save-button on the toolbar. For saving all changed files at once, you could as well
select "Save all" from the File-menu.
<P>Now, when working on a project, it is very annoying if something critical happens while you have done a lot of changes on your
files; sometimes you will bite yourself that you have forgotten to save the changes. KDevelop takes care of this by offering
"Autosaving", which is by default enabled and set to save all files in intervals of 5 minutes. To select another saving period or
to disable this, see 
<A HREF="index-14.html#KDevelop Setup">KDevelop Setup</A>, where the setup options are described.
<P>Additionally, KDevelop takes care for all changes if you open another project or exit KDevelop. You will be asked for saving the
changed files, where you also have the option to specify which one to save and which you want to stay unsaved. Further, when
invoking any build-processes, your files get saved automatically, so you won't ever wonder why your application doesn't run the
way you expected it to do after your changes to the source files. The only exception is the "Compile File" command, which only
saves the currently opened source file visible in the source editor window.
<P>
<H4>Opening and Closing Files</H4>

<P>To open a source file, you have a lot of options as well. One way could be, as the standard for editors, to select "Open" from the
File-menu. You will be presented an "Open File" dialog, which allows you to choose the file you want to edit. Another, probably
more frequently used way is to select the file from the LFV, the Logical File Viewer, or the RFV, the Real File Viewer (see 
<A HREF="index-5.html#Overview">Overview</A>
). The advantage of the file trees is that they provide a quick visual access to your files, especially the LFV,
which only displays your project files by their type, collected into folders. You can as well configure the LFV towards sorting
your files in another manner by a right mouse click on the tree. Select "New Group" from the popup-menu, and you can configure a
new group, or select "Edit Group" to install new file filters by specifying the group's file extensions, separated by commas.
<P>The standard file groups for a project generated by KAppWizard are the Headers, Sources, GNU and Others. Additionally, after
adding a translation file, KDevelop adds a folder "Translations", containing your *.po files.
<P>To close files, select the file to close from the Window-menu, which loads the opened file into the front editor. Then select
"Close" from the File-menu. If your file has been changed, you will be asked to save it. When closing a project, all currently
opened files will be checked for changes and you will be asked for saving as well.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="ss7.2">7.2 Navigating within Files</A>
</H3>

<P>The following gives you a general guideline how to locate certain positions within your files for a quicker access.
<P><B>&raquo; How to find a certain line in a file</B>
<P>
<OL>
<LI>Select "Goto Line" in the "View"-menu or press CTRL+G. The dialogfield "Goto Line" appears.</LI>
<LI>Insert the linenumber you want to go to.</LI>

<LI>A popup-menu opens that allows you to select the bookmark number you want to set for the new bookmark.</LI>
<LI>Select the bookmark number.</LI>
</OL>
<P>Another way to set bookmarks would be to select "Add Bookmark" from the "Bookmarks"-menu. This sets a bookmark to the current line
and appends it to the bookmarks-list. The documentation browser also offers setting a bookmark to the current page by a context menu
entry "Add Bookmark".
<P><B>&raquo; How to delete bookmarks</B>
<P>The bookmarks are set for each editing window separately- mind that your bookmarks aren't connected to a certain file you set the
bookmark for. To delete all bookmarks, select "Delete Bookmarks" from the "Bookmarks"-menu. This deletes the bookmarks for the
window actually on top, either the Header window, the C++ window or the browser window.
<P><B>&raquo; How to go to a bookmarked line</B>

<OL>
<LI>Select the "Bookmarks"-menu and open the popup menu containing the bookmarks for the window containing the bookmark you want
to view; either the C++-Window or the Header-Window entry.</LI>
<LI>Select the bookmarked line.</LI>
</OL>
<P>Selecting a bookmark for the browser window will open the browser and loads the page.

<H3><A NAME="ss7.4">7.4 Edit Windows Settings</A>
</H3>

<P>The editor inside KDevelop can be configured towards special editing needs with a global effect on all editing windows. Thereby
you can set the color modes, highlighting colors (also configurable in reference to the programming language of the file) and
automatic text settings like tab-with and selection modes. The following describes how to set these options by the configuration
dialogs provided in the "Options"-menu.
<P>
<H4>General Settings</H4>

<P>The editor's general settings can be configured with the "Editor" entry in the "Options"-menu. Select the according values and
press OK after you finished with your configuration.

</DL>
<P>
<H4>Colors</H4>

<P>For changing the editor's general appearance, you can define a set of colors that the editor uses by selecting "Editor Colors"
from the "Options"-menu. You can configure colors for:
<UL>
<LI><B>background:      </B>        the editor's background</LI>
<LI><B>text background:  </B>           the background of displayed text</LI>
<LI><B>selected:         </B>       the color of selected text</LI>
<LI><B>found:            </B>       the color of text found by a search via the menu "Edit"-"Search", "Repeat search" and "Replace".</LI>
<LI><B>selected + found: </B>       the color of text selected to search for and found</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<H4>Syntax Highlighting</H4>

<P>The syntax-highlighting mode of KDevelop's editor can be configured by two dialogs; first you can set default colors for
syntax-highlighting by the "Editor Defaults" entry in the "Options"-menu. There, you can set colors and fonts as well as the
fontsize for e.g. keywords. Select the default item and set all needed options.
<P>The second configuration dialog is accessed by the "Syntax-Highlighting" entry in the "Options"-menu. This allows you to set the
file filters for the programming language, e.g. *.cpp, *.h  for C++. Then select the item that you want to configure. If you wish
to use the default values you've set in the "Editor Defaults" dialog, select the "default" checkboxes in the Item-style and
Item-Font sections. This reads the default settings for the selected item. After pressing OK, your new values will be enabled and
used by the editor.

<P>
<H4>Single File Search</H4>

<P><B>&raquo; How to find one or more characters in the actual editing window</B>
<OL>
<LI>Select "Search" from the "Edit"-menu. This opens the search dialog.</LI>
<LI>Specify the expression to search for in the edit field. The drop-down menu offers selecting a previous search expression.</LI>
<LI>Select additional options like "Whole Words only"</LI>
<LI>Press OK.</LI>
</OL>
<P>To repeat searching for an expression entered in the search dialog, press F3.
<P>
<H4>Searching over Several Files</H4>

<P>As the search function only is referencing searches over a single file that is currently visible, you're limited to this. But often
you want to search for the same expression overall your project. Therefore, KDevelop contains a <CODE>grep</CODE>-dialog, which
lets you search over all files that you specify either by setting the directory to start the search from and/or by mime-type.
Specifying the exact directory and the mime-type will therefore reduce the time that KDevelop needs to read your files and display
the results. To start a search over several files, select "Search in files..." from the "Edit"-menu. The search dialog opens and
lets you enter:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>The expression to search for (the pattern)</LI>
<LI>The template used for the search</LI>
<LI>The mime-type of files to search in</LI>
<LI>The directory to start form</LI>
<LI>If the search is recursive over all included subdirectories</LI>
</UL>
<P>By default, the grep-dialog is set to start at your project directory and works recursively over implementation and header files.
<P>You can even extend your search pattern by using the following options:
<P>
<OL>
<LI><B>.</B> Match any character</LI>
<LI><B>^</B> Match the beginning of a line</LI>
<LI><B>$</B> Match the end of a line</LI>
<LI><B>\&lt; </B> Match the beginning of a word</LI>
<LI><B>\> </B> Match the end of a word</LI>
</OL>
<P>For a repeating search, you can also use the available operators:
<OL>
<LI><B>?</B> The preceding item matches less than once</LI>
<LI><B>*</B> The preceding item is matched zero or more times</LI>
<LI><B>+</B> The preceding item is matched once or more times</LI>
<LI><B>{ n }</B> The preceding item is matched exactly <EM>n</EM> times</LI>
<LI><B>{ n,}</B> The preceding item is matched <EM>n</EM> or more times</LI>
<LI><B>{,n }</B> The preceding item matches less than <EM>n</EM> times</LI>
<LI><B>{n,m}</B> The preceding item matches at least <EM>n</EM> times but less than <EM>m</EM> times</LI>
</OL>
<P>Backreferences to bracketed subexpressions are also available by the notation <EM>\n</EM>.
<P>After specifying your search, press "Search". The results are then displayed in the result-window. To jump to a file and line
number, select the resultline and press Enter or double click the result. The editor will automatically open the according file
and place the cursor to the line of the result. This allows a complete specification for any search action and give out exact
results.
<P>KDevelop offers also some more specialized functionality to use grep within the editors and the browser. Select the expression you want
to search for in either of the windows and press SHIFT+F2 or select "grep:&lt;your_expression&gt;" from the right button popup menu.
This will ask grep to search for the selection in your project directory's files and will show the results immediately. Switching to
the result works as described above. From within the editor window, it lasts to place the cursor over a word and start searching; the
word under the cursor will be the search pattern.
<P>
<H4>Searching within Documentation</H4>

<P>While working on a project, you often need to have information about the parameters of member functions you want to use- most
often you remember the function's name that matches your needs, but the parameters are a very hard thing to keep in mind.
Therefore, and for other purposes that may occur, KDevelop contains a search functionality that combines searching expressions
that appear in your files with the documentation browser. To make use of this search functionality, you should have set up the
documentation browser correctly and created the search database. For invoking a search through the documentation, do the
following:
<P>
<OL>
<LI>place your cursor at the word you want to search or mark an expression</LI>
<LI>select "Search Marked Text" from the Help-menu or press the right mouse button to open the context menu; then select
"Look Up: "expression".</LI>
<LI>after the search result page is displayed in the documentation browser, select the page that you think could contain the
information you need.</LI>
<LI>the selected documentation page is displayed and your search result is marked. To display the next result within the same
documentation page, press F3.</LI>
</OL>
<P>This allows you to easily find the information you need. For using the results, the documentation browser allows marking a
selection and copying it to the clipboard. Then return to the file you're editing and select "Paste" from the "Edit"-menu.
<P>For a full description on how to use the Documentation, see 
<A HREF="index-6.html#Using the Searchindex">Using the Searchindex</A>.
<P>
<H4>Replacing Text</H4>

<P>For replacing an expression, select "Search and Replace" from the "Edit"-menu. The "Search and Replace"-dialog lets you specify
the expression to be replaced as well as the replacement expression. Then press OK. The first expression which is found will be
marked, so you can see where the expression is and in which context. Then you can specify by a dialog if the expression shall be
replaced or not. When the search is finished by reaching the end of the current file, you will be asked if you want to start the
search again from the beginning. If you're finished, select "Cancel".
<P>
<H3><A NAME="ss7.6">7.6 Printing</A>
</H3>

<P>As KDevelop is designed to give developers the best access to files and information to reduce development cycles, it also contains
a new printing utility which makes use of <EM>enscript</EM>, a common printing program available for Unix-Systems. 
Besides, you can also print by directly using lpr (the lineprinter device). As using enscript offers the
most options towards printing, you should install it on your system; it is usually shipped with
distributions, so you shouldn't have any problem to get it. But before printing, you should have a look at the available
configuration dialog to prepare the output according to your needs. The following section describes how to configure KDevelop for
printing files.
<P>
<H4>Configuring the Printer</H4>

<P>The printing program can be configured by selecting "Print" from the "File"-menu; on the printing dialog,
select the program by the drop-down-menu in the left upper corner. Then press the "Options" button on the right. This opens the
configuration for the program.  Another way to configure the program is selecting "Printer
