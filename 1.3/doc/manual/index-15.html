<H3><A NAME="Questions and Answers"></A> <A NAME="s15">15. Questions and Answers</A></H3>

<P>This section addresses questions by users that were answered by the KDevelop Team or by their supporters on the KDevelop
mailing list during experiences with the current versions of KDevelop as well as bug reporting in general.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="Bug Reporting"></A> <A NAME="ss15.1">15.1 Bug Reporting </A>
</H3>

<P>Another improvement of KDevelop is the integrated bug-reporting system via email. If you experience a bug, you have the option to send
the KDevelop development team a bug report either by your email-client or by the bug-report dialog. All bug-reports are collected on
the KDevelop web site and can be reviewed on 
<A HREF="http://bugs.kde.org//db/pa/lkdevelop.html">http://bugs.kde.org//db/pa/lkdevelop.html</A>. 
<P>To send bug reports, please use the email address 
<A HREF="mailto:submit@bugs.kde.org">submit@bugs.kde.org</A>. If you want to use KDevelop for direct bug-reporting, choose
"Bug Report" from the Help-menu. You are presented the report dialog that lets you enter all necessary information about the
bug you found. After pressing "OK", the dialog's contents is sent there automatically.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="ss15.2">15.2 Where to get Information</A>
</H3>

<P><B>Q:</B> I have a question which is not addressed in the FAQ file, nor in the manuals of KDevelop. Where should I turn to ?
<P><B>A:</B>  In any case send all requests that are regarding KDevelop by subscribing to the KDevelop mailing list at 
<A HREF="mailto:kdevelop-request@barney.cs.uni-potsdam.de">kdevelop-request@barney.cs.uni-potsdam.de</A>. Send a mail with an empty header and
"subscribe youremailaddres" as contents; then you can participate on the discussions. All questions should go there and will be addressed there as well.
If you stick to that, you will get the most help by the developers and all users having the same problems, as well as helping to keep
the FAQ up to date.
<P>The KDevelop Homepage at 
<A HREF="http://www.kdevelop.org">http://www.kdevelop.org</A> also contains a mailing-list archive that allows you to browse
the mails already send by the subscribers, so you should look there first as most problems should have been addressed already by the
team or other users.

<H3><A NAME="ss15.3">15.3 Library and System Problems</A>
</H3>

<P>
<P><B>Q:</B> Wrong JPEG library version: library is 61, caller expects 62
<P><B>A:</B>  There are 2 ways.
<OL>
<LI> When the kdelibs are installed it installs header files for the
jpeg libraries, these are version 61,  however most distributions
(Redhat) use version 62 libraries. To fix  this just remove jpeglib.h
from /opt/kde/include. The pukka include  file for version 62 should
then be picked up. However looking at the  error message above it may
be the other way round, in any case ensure  you only have on version
of the header file, the library and that  they are consistent.

It is useful to use the locate command to verify that I have
the correct version of a library and header files e.g.
updatedb
locate libjpeg
locate jpeglib
</LI>
<LI> You must recompiled kdesupport without jpeg
library (./configure --with-libjpeg --with-libgif).</LI>
</OL>

make[2]: Entering directory `/usr/local/src/kdevelop-0.3/po'
cd .. &amp;&amp; automake --gnu --include-deps po/Makefile

<B>A:</B>  Workaround for automake-1.4/automake-2.13 users: Just run
"aclocal" manually, then it will compile.
<P>
<P><B>Q:</B>  What must i do, if configure said ,that i need giflib23.
<P><B>A:</B>  Try a newer snap of kdesupport, or maybe you have another giflib installed?
<P>
<P><B>Q:</B> How can I convert a KDevelop 0.2 project to a 0.3 one?
<P><B>A:</B> Please change the AC_OUTPUT in the configure.in to a oneline version
<P>for example:
old version:

AC_OUTPUT(Makefile \
kdevelop/kwrite/Makefile \
kdevelop/templates/Makefile

new version:

<B>A:</B> If you have the SuSE rpm´s of KDE-1.1, you must recompile the kdelibs without the patch commited by SuSE and reinstall
them or get an updated rpm of the kdelibs from

<H3><A NAME="ss15.4">15.4 Usage Questions</A>
</H3>

<P><B>Q:</B> I see the KDevelop does not allow for usage of the delete key (or backspace deleting when text is marked).
<P><B>A:</B>  go to "Options"->"Editor" and make sure that "Delete on Input" is enabled, then backspace and delete works.
<P>
<P><B>Q:</B> If I add files to my project, will they be automatically included and compiled ?
<P><B>A:</B> Yes, they are included in the Makefile.am's then and if you make a "Rebuild All" (./configure updates the Makefiles), your new
added files will be included as well.
<P><B>Q:</B> If I removed a file, I get some weird Linker messages. What is wrong with my project ?
<P><B>A:</B> If the removed file is a header file, that is automatically processed by automoc (running the Qt-Meta-Object-Compiler
automatically on all headers), your removed header is still present as a moc-generated *.moc.cpp file and compiled.  Remove the
according *.moc.cpp file and rebuild the project.
