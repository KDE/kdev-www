<H3><A NAME="s6">6. Application Concepts</A></H3>

<P>This chapter now introduces you into the ideas of the application models mentioned already: the MDI (Multiple Document Interface) and
the Document-View model. A basic introduction into the Document-View model and the generating of a project with KDevelop is already
given in 
<A HREF="../programming/index.html">The KDevelop Programming Handbook</A>, but based on a Single Document Interface
(SDI). In any case, you should be familiar with the basics of the KDE and Qt classes that are explained in 
<A HREF="../kde_libref/index.html">The KDE Library Reference Guide</A>, there the base classes of the underlying libraries are
explained in detail and how to use them, with an additional description of the Qt signal-slot mechanism and event handling.
<P>As a guideline, you should know already:
<UL>
<LI>that every KDE application needs one instance of <CODE>KApplication</CODE> (for a Qt application one instance of
<CODE>QApplication</CODE>)</LI>
<LI>generally a main window is inherited from <CODE>KTMainWindow</CODE> for KDE (for a Qt application inherited from
<CODE>QMainWindow</CODE>)</LI>
<LI>that events (e.g. keyboard presses or mouse movements) are sent to the application by the underlying window system</LI>
<LI>that <CODE>QWidget</CODE> as the base class for all visible Graphical User Interface (GUI) components provides specialized event
handlers by virtual functions that filter out the according events by reimplementing <CODE>QObject::event()</CODE></LI>
<LI>that the Qt signal-slot mechanism means basically that a component can send out signals and a receiver can connect to those
signals to process some actions</LI>
<LI>that this mechanism avoids inheriting classes for GUI components because the signals inform you about e.g. mouse presses  where
appropriate for a wiget</LI>
</UL>

<H3><A NAME="ss6.1">6.1 The Document-View Model</A>
</H3>

<P>The Document-View Model is one of the most basic concepts in application design that rely on graphical user interfaces. Therefore, a
certain understanding of the why is needed to see that although the programmer has other possibilities, it makes sense to make use of
it. But first let's follow the usual design of a typical KDE / Qt application:
<P>Your application instance provides the first connection to your application and is the starting point of the event handling for a
program. The program itself represents itself to the user by a Graphical User Interface which is most often called a main-window. The
main window then provides the appropriate functions for the user such as key accelerators, a menubar, toolbar and a statusbar. In the
center it contains a so-called "view-area" which means that this part is an instance of another class, usually called a "View". The
view instance is created when the main window gets constructed at program start and has to be set as the view area component with a
method provided by the main window: <CODE>setView(your_view)</CODE> for KDE applications using <CODE>KTMainWindow</CODE>,
<CODE>setCentralWidget(your_view)</CODE> for a Qt application using <CODE>QMainWindow</CODE>. Now, the view obviously is the area that is
responsible for interacting with the user to manipulate the data that it represents. As an example, you could use a
<CODE>QMultiLineEdit</CODE> as a view and you will have an editor. Then you can use the provided slots of the view for connections to
menubar or toolbar command like this:
<P>While creating the menubar, you want to provide a method for the command "cut" in the "Edit" menu:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
  pEditMenu->insertItem(BarIcon("editcut"), i18n("Cu&amp;t"),view, SLOT(cut()),KAccel::Cut, ID_EDIT_CUT);
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>This creates a menu item in the "Edit" menu, that, when activated, directly calls the slot <CODE>cut()</CODE> of the instance
<CODE>view</CODE>, whereby we suppose you have created this instance as a <CODE>QMultiLineEdit</CODE> and set as the view area. The
multilineedit's slot gets called and cuts out the selected text as a reaction, the functionality is already provided by the class
itself and so there is no need to inherit from <CODE>QMultiLineEdit</CODE> to create a view area that is capable of such actions. They are
ready to use and make application development very fast- you just need the application instance and the main window including the
connections to your view area and you're done ! That means, a simple editor can be written by creating one single class that defines
the main window behavoir and how to save and read files into the editor - just some basic slots your main view has to implement itself.
<P>But here is the reason why we're now introducing this mysterious Document-View model: You have to provide methods by your own to read
and write the actual files you want to edit with the <CODE>QMultiLineEdit</CODE> view-area <B>within</B> the main window's interface.
Yes, this is obviously the easiest thing to do in this case, and the most logic. Now, if we have a look at the files and their contents
as a so-called "Document", which we can subscribe with the attribute of an "Object" in C++ terminology, the next step is just a little
one: If I have a document, a view and a main window- why don't I separate these three objects from each other ? We could easily create
a small class that is responsible for reading in a file into a text stream and then call the view to draw the text visible to the user.
The same applies to saving the file again- the document class should then provide a saving method that retrieves the text from the view
again and saves it as a file. In the example these two methods would be the only actions that are needed to be done by a document
class, because the edit-view already provides all methods basically needed for and editor by slots and you can manipulate the content
of the view by them directly.
<P>Now, the main idea behind the need for this separation into three objects (document, view, main window) instead of the minimum of two,
the view and the main window, is the question: what if I want to give the user the possibility to work with a file by <B>two</B> or
even more views ? Such things can even be done within one main window by splitters or deviders containing two view instances which
shall both display <B>one</B> file. There it is: the solution can only be that if the user manipulates the file contents in one view,
the other view has to be notified about that and to actualize its contents. Otherwise a bad scenario will occur: if the user closes one
view where he added something at the end of the file which he cutted out at the beginning of the file <B>in</B> the other view, the
file will be saved later by still containing the cutted section, because if the second and last view did not recognize this, it still
contains the text without modification from the beginning plus the inserted one. This means that both views have to be synchronized by
their contents they are displaying and that can be done if all views get notified about each action that the user does, which view he
actually uses should be equal. That means that finally a document class is needed to be the one and only holder of the true contents of
the document and is providing the views the possibility to manipulate the contents.
<P>I hope this has given some insight into this model, although in most cases it seems that the programmer can live without it - equally
to just using a provided class as the view area or writing a widget on his own to handle user interaction, as long as you represent
<B>one</B> document or file by <B>one</B> view area, the view can be responsible for the data as well and only provide methods to
retrieve or set the document contents for actions like reading a file or saving it. The next model to describe, the Multiple Document
Interface, will make a difference at this point- there you will see the actual need and the functionality the Document-View model
provides.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="ss6.2">6.2 The Multiple Document Interface (MDI)</A>
</H3>

<P>As the last section described the Document-View model, you will probably guess what MDI means. Users that come from other Operating
Systems than Unix/Linux are used to it as well as programmers developing for those platforms. While X-Window applications traditionally
are more targeting towards functionality and stability, Unix users are used to single windows that provide functionality, therefore
even the Document-View model is often not needed to create applications. With Qt as a multi-platform toolkit, developers are having
even more choice - developing for MS Windows(tm) as well as for Unix systems. While on Windows the lack of creating applications that
are capable of handling so-called child windows has been getting to some kind of standard, this is adressed by the Qt 2.1 library, but
on the other hand Unix users can profit from this architecture as well.
<P>What is now the meaning of MDI ? An MDI application generally has the same concept of a usual application that has, as described above,
one application instance and a main window. The view area now make the difference: you don't directly use a view that represents data
and provides interaction to manipulate that data but a view that handles other windows looking like top-level windows. These windows
are now representing the former view area and the main difference is that the interaction chain changes from
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
application instance -> main window -> view

to

appliation instance -> main window -> view -> active child window
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The view now is capable of several actions:
<UL>
<LI>creating as much child windows as the user requests</LI>
<LI>providing methods to retrieve the currently active child window</LI>
<LI>maintaining a list of open views</LI>
<LI>managing the child window behavoir for maximize, minimize such as a window manager does for top-level windows</LI>
</UL>
<P>Now, you can use "complete" widgets like the <CODE>QMultiLineEdit</CODE> as child windows like for an application that only provides one
window and each child window is responsible for it's own data. That could be described as "Multiple Document Interface", whereby each
child window is equal to a single document. The application then manages the usual actions such as providing methods for the child
window interaction such as cut or copy. Extending this concept with the document-view model enhances the possibilities by far: imagine
that you can open as much windows as you like within the main window and that a new child window can be a new view of a document that
is already shown by another child window. The management for this requires a separation into the already described three objects model,
but doesn't limit the actual number of instances of the documents as well as the views.
<P>Fortunately, Qt 2.1 contains the possibility to create such applications and KDevelop provides you with the according application
frameworks for both, Qt-only programs as well as KDE 2 applications with the same interface methods- so it is adequate wether you want
to develop for one of these. Using KDE 2 interfaces will offer you still more possibilites by library functions as well as
inter-process communication, but those are special aspects that are to cover by separate introductions to these techniques.
<P>Now you are prepared for following the development for KDE 2 - just follow the next chapter to get a first look at the functionality
already provided by KDevelop when creating applications. There, we will generate the framework for our tutorial application
<EM>KScribble</EM> and describe the practical aspects of programming MDI applications.
