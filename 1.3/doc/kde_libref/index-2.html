<H3><A NAME="s2">2. Class Categories</A></H3>

<P>The KDE/Qt C++ class libraries offer easy solutions to extend applications dramatically with a minimum amount of coding on the side of
the application programmer. This chapter sorts the classes provided towards their usage by certain categories:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Baseclass</LI>
<LI>Application architecture classes    
<UL>
<LI>Application objects of KDE</LI>
<LI>Application configuration</LI>
<LI>Main Windows</LI>
</UL>
</LI>
<LI>User Interface Objects
<UL>
<LI>Views</LI>
<LI>Dialogs</LI>
<LI>Control Elements</LI>
<LI>Menus</LI>
</UL>
</LI>
<LI>General purpose classes
<UL>
<LI>Files</LI>
<LI>Data objects</LI>
<LI>Graphics</LI>
<LI>Processes</LI>
</UL>
</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<H3><A NAME="ss2.1">2.1 Baseclass</A>
</H3>

<P>
<P>Most of the KDE/Qt classes have <CODE>QObject</CODE> as their baseclass in their inheritance hierarchy. <CODE>QObject</CODE> can be described as a
baseclass because it offers the usage of Qt's signal/slot mechanism which allows object interaction within the application and should
be used as the baseclass for any self-created classes that are supposed to emit signals or can connect to signals by slots.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="ss2.2">2.2 Application Architecture Classes</A>
</H3>

<P>KDE applications usually consist of a set of objects that interact with each other. The programmer has to use the provided classes to
create a KDE application either by creating a class instance or by inheritance. A typical application contains:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>One application object of <CODE>KApplication</CODE></LI>
<LI>One main window class derived from <CODE>KTMainWindow</CODE></LI>
<LI>A class derived from <CODE>QWidget</CODE> to create the view area</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<P>
<H4>Application objects of KDE</H4>

<P>The K Desktop Environment provides functionality that an application can use to integrate into the KDE. This functionality
is implemented in the class
<CODE>KApplication</CODE> and should therefore be the baseclass for any application that targets KDE. A KDE application only contains one object of the
class <CODE>KApplication</CODE>. This is created in the application's <CODE>main()</CODE> function. The <CODE>KApplication</CODE> object is responsible for
providing the basic interfaces and objects towards the desktop and interprets the command-line arguments of an application. As the
instance is a non-visible, but the main application object, the following rules have to be watched:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>the application is terminated by <CODE>kapp->quit()</CODE>.</LI>
<LI>the object that is representing the graphical interface has to be set the main widget with <CODE>setTopWidget()</CODE> (for widgets not
inherited by <CODE>KTMainWindow</CODE>)</LI>
</UL>
<P>The <CODE>KApplication</CODE> object provides:
<UL>
<LI>access to the KDE File System</LI>
<LI>a session configuration object</LI>
<LI>a configuration object</LI>
<LI>internationalization by the locale object</LI>
<LI>changing of the visible application objects by signals</LI>
</UL>
<BLOCKQUOTE>KDE 2 accesses the according instances by static methods provided by <CODE>KGlobal</CODE>.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<P><B>Dependencies:</B> -lkdecore -lqt
<P><B>Includes:</B> <CODE>#include &lt;kapp.h&gt;</CODE>
<P>The <CODE>kdeui</CODE> library additionally offers two classes that inherit <CODE>KApplication</CODE> for specialized purposes:
<P>
<H4>KWMModuleApplication</H4>

<P><B>Includes:</B> <CODE>#include &lt;kwmmapp.h&gt;</CODE>
<P><B>Dependencies:</B> -lkdeui -lkdecore -lqt
<P>The class KWMModuleApplication is the base class for KDE window-manager modules. It mainly informs a module about all currently managed
windows and changes to them (via Qt signals). There are no methods to manipulate windows. These are defined in the class KWM (see
kwm.h). An example for using KWMModuleApplication is kcontrol.
<P>
<H4>KControlApplication</H4>

<P>
<P><B>Includes:</B> <CODE>#include &lt;kcontrol.h&gt;</CODE>
<P><B>Dependencies:</B> -lkdeui -lkdecore -lqt
<P>KControlApplication is the common base for setup applications. It provides a tab dialog and functionality common to most setup
programs. The configuration dialogs for the KDE are examples of KControlApplications.
<P>
<H4>KWM</H4>

<P><B>Includes:</B> <CODE>#include &lt;kwm.h&gt;</CODE>
<P><B>Dependencies:</B> -lkdeui -lkdecore -lqt
<P>The KWM class provides a set of static methods to interact with the window and session-manager. Therefore, call any member with
<P>KWM::&lt;method()&gt;
<P>depending on the purpose of the desired functionality.
<P>
<P>
<H4>Application Configuration</H4>

<P>The class <CODE>KConfig</CODE> provides the usage of a configuration object which can write its entries into configuration files. Dependent of
the values to read and write you have to call the methods of the class <CODE>KConfigBase</CODE>.
<P>The <CODE>KApplication</CODE> object provides an application configuration object with a resource file by default which is stored in the user's
kde-directory as well as the session management file to store information between sessions.
<P>For internationalization, the <CODE>KApplication</CODE> object uses the class <CODE>KLocale</CODE> to translate localized entries dependent on the
selected language. Instead of using the <CODE>klocale->translate()</CODE> method, KDE applications should use the <CODE>i18n()</CODE> macro that
contains the string to be translated as the message extraction depends on this macro.
<P>
<H4>Main Windows</H4>

<P>As the application's <CODE>KApplication</CODE> instance is non-visible, it only provides the basic means to create a KDE application.
Therefore a KDE application needs to have a main window representing the application towards the user graphically. The main window
usually consists of a widget which can be as simple as a pure button up to the complex <CODE>KTMainWindow</CODE> widget, offering the means to
create a full-featured main window with geometry management, session management support, menu bar, toolbars and statusbar.
<P>Generally, every main window has to be set main widget with <CODE>KApplication</CODE>'s <CODE>setTopWidget()</CODE> method. An exception is a main
window that inherits <CODE>KTMainWindow</CODE>.
<P>The main window usually takes the responsibility to terminate the application by providing a user interface that is connected to
<CODE>KApplication::quit()</CODE>, easily used by <CODE>kapp->quit()</CODE>.
<P>Most KDE applications will use <CODE>KTMainWindow</CODE> to represent the application graphically.
<P>
<P>
<H3><A NAME="ss2.3">2.3 User Interface Objects</A>
</H3>

<P>This section covers the user interface object the KDE libraries provide. By category, these can be divided by their purpose. A user
interface can be:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>a view area widget, representing the data an application is intended to produce and allowing the methods to manipulate the
contents.</LI>
<LI>dialogs, used to retrieve user input, e.g. a file dialog</LI>
<LI>control elements to compose application specific widgets</LI>
<LI>menus, providing user interfaces to invoke application commands.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<H4>Views</H4>

<P>View are generally the content area of an application. Therefore it can be the main widget or a part of a main widget that additionally
offers a set of functionality such as <CODE>KTMainWindow</CODE>
<P>The KDE libraries offer a set of ready to use views which can be inherited to advance the desired functionality:
<UL>
<LI>KTabListBox: offers a multi-column list box where the user can change the rows with drag'n drop.</LI>
<LI>KEdit: the base classes for the KEdit application offered with KDE. This could be used instead of QMultiLineEdit.</LI>
<LI>KNewPanner: manages two child widgets like QSplitter.
<BLOCKQUOTE>Removed in KDE 2. Use QSplitter instead.</BLOCKQUOTE>
</LI>
<LI>KHTMLView: a HTML-interpreting widget (khtmlw)</LI>
</UL>
<P>For use with <CODE>KTMainWindow</CODE>, create your view instance and call <CODE>setView(QWidget*)</CODE> to enable the management by the
<CODE>KTMainWindow</CODE> instance.
<P>Individual views are usually created by inheritance of <CODE>QWidget</CODE> or any provided widget that comes closest to the desired
functionality the view should offer. For widgets that want to offer scrolling facilities, you could inherit from <CODE>QScrollView</CODE> or
create a <CODE>QScrollView</CODE> instance and set the view widget as the managed area with <CODE>addChild()</CODE>.
<P>
<H4>Dialogs</H4>

<P>Dialogs are a main part of the user interaction wherever the application requires parameters that have to be set by the user.
Fortunately, the KDE library already offers a set of dialogs that are ready to use for standard parameters such as fonts and colors. In
any case where these types of information is requested by the user, the application should make use of these standard dialogs.
<P>In cases where the given dialogs don't fit the requirements, you have to inherit from <CODE>QWidget</CODE> or <CODE>QDialog</CODE> and create your own
dialog either directly coded with geometry management or by creating it visually with KDevelop's dialogeditor.
<P>The KDE libraries offer the following dialogs:
<UL>
<LI>KColorDialog: selects a color value</LI>
<LI>KWizard: base dialog class to create wizards</LI>
<LI>KEdGotoLine: Go-to-Line dialog for editors</LI>
<LI>KEdReplace: Search and replace dialog for editors</LI>
<LI>KEdSrch: search dialog for editors</LI>
<LI>KFontDialog: font selection dialog</LI>
<LI>KIconLoaderDialog: Icon selection dialog</LI>
<LI>KKeyDialog: keyboard accelerator configuration dialog</LI>
<LI>KMsgBox: message box dialog with up to four configurable buttons</LI>
<LI>KFileDialog: (kfile) file dialog to open and save files</LI>
<LI>KSpellDlg: (kspell) spell-checking dialog for use with Ispell</LI>
<LI>DatePickerDialog: (kab) date selection dialog</LI>
</UL>
<P>Additionally, the Qt library offers:
<UL>
<LI>QFileDialog</LI>
<LI>QMessageBox</LI>
<LI>QPrintDialog</LI>
<LI>QProgressDialog</LI>
</UL>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Qt 2.0 introduces a QColorDialog for selecting colors and a QFontDialog for font-selection as well </BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<H3><A NAME="ss2.4">2.4 Control Elements</A>
</H3>

<P>Control elements are used within visible areas of the application and can be combined together to create a dialog or view. Beyond the
control elements that the Qt library provides, KDE offers:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>KButton: active raise-lower button</LI>
<LI>KButtonBox: manages buttons</LI>
<LI>KColorButton: button displaying a color setting, calls <CODE>KColorDialog</CODE></LI>
<LI>KIconLoaderButton: button displaying a selected Icon, calls <CODE>KIconLoaderDialog</CODE></LI>
<LI>KDatePicker: Date selection widget</LI>
<LI>KIntegerLine: line edit that only accepts integer values</LI>
<LI>KLedLamp: LED lamp</LI>
<LI>KLined: line edit</LI>
<LI>KNewPanner: panner devider managing two widgets
<BLOCKQUOTE>Use <CODE>QSplitter</CODE> instead, this is already removed in KDE 2.</BLOCKQUOTE>
</LI>
<LI>KPopupMenu: popup menu with title</LI>
<LI>KRestrictedLine: line edit that only accepts certain input</LI>
<LI>KSelector: value selector</LI>
<LI>KSeparator: standard separator</LI>
<LI>KSlider: slider widget</LI>
<LI>KTabCtl: tabulator widget</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<H3><A NAME="ss2.5">2.5 General Purpose Classes</A>
</H3>

<P>
<H4>Files and Directories</H4>

<P>Qt already offers a set of classes to work with files and directories. Those classes are:
<P>
<UL>
<LI><CODE>QDir</CODE></LI>
<LI><CODE>QFileInfo</CODE></LI>
<LI><CODE>QFile</CODE></LI>
<LI><CODE>QFileDialog</CODE></LI>
</UL>
<P>A comparable and extended technology has been introduced by the KDE libraries and have a similar usage like the corresponding classes
of Qt. Those are:
<P>
<UL>
<LI><CODE>KDir</CODE></LI>
<LI><CODE>KFileInfo</CODE></LI>
<LI><CODE>KFileDialog</CODE></LI>
<LI><CODE>KFilePreviewDialog</CODE></LI>
</UL>
<P>For loading and saving files, use the class <CODE>QFile</CODE> which operates with streams. If you want network transparent
file access, consider using <CODE>KFile</CODE>.
<P>
<H4>Data Objects</H4>

<P>The Qt library supports data objects by classes that offer handling of lists, arrays, streams, strings and the like. See the Qt
documentation for mor information.
<P>
<H4>Graphics</H4>

<P>Qt supports a set of graphics formats that can be used for drawings or image programs. The graphics device for painting is
<CODE>QPainter</CODE>.
<P>
<H4>Processes</H4>

<P>As applications can have different types of application communication with other programs available on the system such as standard Unix
actions, developers can make use of the class <CODE>KProcess</CODE> to call another application. As the application is running independently
from the one that invoked it, you can only receive the current status of the application invoked by <CODE>isRunning()</CODE>. Also, the
invocation can be done with various initialization values. Finally, the process can inform the application whether it has been
terminated or ended. See <CODE>KProcess</CODE> for details.
