<P>DATELINE DECEMBER 10, 2000</P>
<P>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE</P>
<H3 ALIGN="center">New Release of the KDevelop C/C++ IDE for the KDE Desktop</H3>
<P>
<STRONG>New Version of Leading C/C++ Integrated Development Environment for
Linux and Other UNIXes Ships
</STRONG>
</P>

<P>December 11, 2000 (The INTERNET).  The <A
HREF="http://www.kdevelop.org/">KDevelop Team</A> today announced the release of
KDevelop 1.3, a powerful, easy to use, Integrated Development Environment for
the C and C++ Programming Language based on KDE. KDevelop 1.3 is a major
update release that follows the successful versions 1.1 and 1.2 to enable
developers for rapid application development for the new <A
HREF="http://www.kde.org">KDE 2.0</A> Desktop. KDevelop is the work of an
international team dedicated in providing an IDE under the Linux and UNIX
operating systems, their freely available product is known to be stable and
improving productivity for any C/C++ developer.
</P>
<P>
The primary goals of the 1.3 release are to simplify the development process of
new applications for the UNIX desktop KDE 2.0, to enable corporations to
easily deploy the leading API of KDE 2.0 and ease their decision to create
programs that are using the newest Office and Inter-Process-Communication
facilities that currently arose on the UNIX desktop with the latest release of
KDE. </P>
<P>
Specifically the new development tools provided by <A
HREF="http://www.trolltech.com/">Trolltech</A>, the Qt Designer and the upcoming
Qt Linguist, as well as the KDE internationalization program KBabel are directly
supported and integrated into the development process. Another major feature,
the Projectfile Generator included in KDevelop, allows to easily work on already
existing automake projects with KDevelop as a matter of seconds that will bring
the full sense of the GPL and other Free Software licenses to their destination
of code-reuse where possible. Now developers can have a look at the full KDE
sourcecode and any other project to look up the code for the functionality they
want to provide in their application. The availability of the Qt and KDE API
within the development environment simplifies and reduces the effort developers
have to put into finding the information they need for programming under
time-to-market aspects.
</P>
<P>
While KDevelop 1.3 is still based on KDE 1.1.2 code, the team provides a binary
version that has proven to run on most Linux distributions without having KDE
1.1.2 libraries installed. Therefore, developers whose systems are not enabled
to compile KDE 1.1.2 applications can still make simple use of the C/C++ IDE for
rapid application development. </P>
<P>
The KDevelop 1.3 IDE is available for free under the GNU General Public License
(GPL) as KDE is available on Open Source licenses. Likewise,
<A HREF="http://www.trolltech.com/">Trolltech's</A> Qt 2.2.2, the GUI
toolkit on which KDE is based,
is also available for free under two Open Source licenses:  the
<A HREF="http://www.trolltech.com/products/download/freelicense/license.html">Q
Public License</A> and the <A HREF="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html">GNU
General Public License</A>.
</P>
<P>
More information about KDevelop 1.3 is available on the
<A HREF="http://www.kdevelop.org">KDevelop Home Page</A> and on
<A HREF="http://www.kde.org/">KDE's web site</A>, along with
<A HREF="http://developer.kde.org/documentation/kde2arch.html">developer
information</A> and a developer's <A

<H4>Downloading and Compiling KDevelop</H4>
<P>
The source packages for KDevelop 1.3 are available for free download at
<A
HREF="ftp://ftp.kdevelop.org/pub/kdevelop/">ftp://ftp.kdevelop.org/pub/
kdevelop/</A>  or at one of the many KDevelop ftp
server <A HREF="http://www.kdevelop.org">mirrors</A>. KDevelop 1.3
requires qt-1.44, which is available from TrollTech´s ftp server at <A
HREF="ftp://ftp.troll.no">ftp://ftp.troll.no</A> and the KDE 1.1.2 libraries,
available at the KDE ftp servers at <A
HREF="ftp://ftp.kde.org">ftp://ftp.kde.org</A> for compilation, for developing
applications you can feel free to choose either version of the KDE 1.1.2 or KDE
2.0 as well as Qt 1.44 or Qt >2.2.1 libraries as both are directly supported.
</P>
<P> For further instructions on compiling and installing KDevelop, please
consult the installation
instructions provided with the source package of KDevelop.
</P>
<H4>Installing Binary Packages</H4>
<P>
Some distributors choose to provide only packages of KDE 2.0 for certain
versions of their distribution already. As this prevents compiling KDevelop due
to a lack of a KDE 1.1.2 installation, the KDevelop Team provides a binary
version that is known to work under most Linux versions. The binary version of
KDevelop is therefore available for free download under <A
HREF="ftp://ftp.kdevelop.org/pub/kdevelop/">ftp://ftp.kdevelop.org/pub/kdevelop/
</A> or under the equivalent directory at one of the many KDevelop ftp server
<A HREF="http://www.kdevelop.org">mirrors</A>. </P>
<H4>About the KDevelop Project</H4>
<P>
The KDevelop Project, started in summer 1998, aims to provide developers with a
good, stable and useful environment which can compete with modern IDEs found on
other operating systems. Since the beginning of the development, the team has
grown from three members of the core team to over ten codewriters and
a translation team with over 50 people all dedicating their free time to work
on this project. In the meantime, a lot of successfull users of the KDevelop IDE
have joined and shared their experience to improve KDevelop in stability and
functionality.
