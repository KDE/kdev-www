"A small team of 27 developers contributed over a timespan of fifteen months to this release.

<H4>About KDevelop</H4>
<P>
KDevelop supports a number of programming languages, version control systems, debuggers, documentation formats and build tools. Kate is used as the preferred editor, but any editor supporting the KTextEditor interfaces can be used as native KDevelop editor. Build tools like automake and qmake are supported natively, meaning that KDevelop does not maintain its own object repository. Changes in the native project files will be reflected in KDevelop and vice-versa. 
</P><P>
KDevelop also offers a class view showing all the symbols either in a flat view or hierarchical view by namespaces and allows easy code-navigation. A background parser updates the symbols on the fly and also shows syntactical errors in the source code. The code completion even deals with external libraries and Qt signals and slots. 
</P><P>
With its open architecture, KDevelop can be customized and extended in every respect. The user interface features a code-centric approach with on-demand tool-views.
</P><P>
KDevelop features extensive support for navigating the source code. Symbols and filenames can be accessed by just typing part of the name, recently modified files can be reached with a simple keystroke. 
</P><P>
KDevelop offers documentation generators, code debugging, memory checking, code refactoring, bookmark management, and dozens of tools to make development easy and convenient.
