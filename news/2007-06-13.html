<b>KDevelop Platform Libraries API Reference</b><br>
The next generation KDevelop will be KDevelop 4.0.
It is based on new technologies like
<a href="http://trolltech.com/products/qt/whatsnew">Qt&nbsp;4.3</a>
and
<a href="http://www.kde.org/announcements/announce-4.0-alpha1.php">KDE&nbsp;4.0</a>.
To make it easier for others to use the power of KDevelop to build their own,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment" title="Integrated Development Environment">IDE-like</a>,
application we have split KDevelop into a library -
<a href="http://api.kde.org/4.x-api/kdevplatform-apidocs/">
the KDevelop platform</a> - and the application itself - KDevelop.
This way future applications like kile, quanta, etc can share the same base code with KDevelop and profit from code reuse.
So start by reading the
<a href="http://api.kde.org/4.x-api/kdevplatform-apidocs/">
KDevelop Platform Libraries API Reference</a> before coding your next application.
