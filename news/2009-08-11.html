<b>KDevelop 3.5.5 released</b><br>
For users that
<a href="/mediawiki/index.php/KDevelop_4/KDev3_KDev4_comparison_table">
for some reason</a>
can not update to KDevelop4, we released a bugfix version of the KDevelop3 series.
KDevelop3 development was stopped around October 2008, but users have occasionally sent us patches that we incorporated in this release.
Please download it from
<a href="/index.html?filename=3.5/download.html">
our download page</a>
because the binaries provided by some linux distros are crippled.
