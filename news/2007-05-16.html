<b>Binaries of KDevelop 3.4.1 final for Debian, Fedora, Mandriva, Klik, SuSE, and (K)Ubuntu are available</b><br>
Get them at the usual place, the
<a href="index.html?filename=3.4/download.html">KDevelop 3.4.x download page</a>,
they contain all the
<a href="index.html?filename=3.4/ChangeLog.html">changes</a>
up to revision 665073.
But due to some library issues on the
<a href="http://build.opensuse.org/">build servers</a>
we use, these packages have SVN support disabled.
If you need SVN support you will need to
<a href="index.html?filename=3.4/branches_compiling.html">
compile KDevelop 3.4.1 from sources</a> yourself.
