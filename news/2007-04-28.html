<h2>KDevelop 3.4.1 preview 2 (a.k.a. 3.4.0.2)
binary only public release</h2><p>
A snapshot of current SVN development from yesterday is available on our
<a href="index.html?filename=3.4/download.html">
KDevelop 3.4.x download page</a>.
It's a binary only release (.rpms) and it's only available for SuSE and Mandriva 2006, sorry for that. The feedback we get on this release will be used to fine tune the final KDevelop 3.4.1 release scheduled to be
<a href="http://techbase.kde.org/Schedules/KDE_3.5_Release_Schedule#KDE_3.5.7">
