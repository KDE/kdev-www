<h2>Happy birthday KDevelop, you old git !</h2><p>
KDevelop4 has turned five years old today.
Andreas Pakulat our release coordinator offered a special present to all our users and developers, he moved KDevelop from SVN to a
<a href="http://gitorious.org/kdevelop">
git source repository</a>.
Now it's even easier to contribute to KDevelop.
