<H3 ALIGN="center">KDevelop <?php echo $k_base_version; ?> release Announcement</H3>
<P><STRONG>The KDevelop Team Ships Major Feature Release of Award-Winning Open Source IDE</STRONG></P>
<P>March 16, 2005 (The INTERNET).
The KDevelop Team is proud to ship KDevelop <?php echo $k_base_version; ?>, the third major release of this award-winning Integrated Development Environment (IDE).
</P>
<P>
"KDevelop is a key to reaching brand new levels of productivity. It is an IDE suitable for every task from system programming to GUI RAD development. Integrating all standard UNIX development tools, providing support for team development with various version control system tools and having a large list of supported languages, KDevelop is an excellent choice for UNIX developers. Available on different platforms such as Mac OS X and Windows/Cygwin, KDevelop is a great tool for multiplatform development. Support for common development tools allows to develop applications for a large number of platforms including embedded platforms" said Alexander Dymo, project co-maintainer.
</P>
<P>
"With its new language-independent, plugin-based core and wide support for common development tools, KDevelop is already the de-facto standard IDE on Linux/Unix desktops" added Harald Fernengel, long-time project member.
</P>
<P>
"KDevelop is now a great general purpose framework for developing IDEs, rather than just a mainly 'C++ only' IDE" suggested Richard Dale a new KDevelop team-member.
</P>
<P>
"Over 30 developers contributed over a timespan of seven months to the project. The userbase has been growing steadily, the average download of 20 times per hour is a prof of it, and that gave us lots of inputs on how to improve the program. We also got new developers that brought new and fresh ideas" noted Amilcar do Carmo Lucas, release co-coordinator.
</P>

<H4>Major Enhancements</H4>
<P>
The focus of this release was the improvement of the RAD capabilities of the integrated GUI designer and documentation browser, improvement of the <em>Ruby</em> programming language support.
</P><P>
KDevelop supports over 15 programming languages and numerous version control systems, debuggers, documentation formats and build tools. Any Editor supporting the KTextEditor interfaces can be used as native KDevelop editor, including Kate, QEditor and Yzis. Build tools like automake, qmake and ant are supported natively, meaning that KDevelop does not maintain its own object repository. Changes in the native project files will be reflected in KDevelop and vice-versa. 
</P><P>
It offers a class view showing all the symbols either flat or hierarchical by namespaces and allows easy code-navigation. A background parser updates the symbols on the fly and also shows syntactical errors in the source code. The code completion even deals with external libraries and Qt signals and slots. 
</P><P>
With its open architecture, KDevelop can be customized and extended in every respect. The core IDE functionality has been moved to a set of libraries called "KDevelop platform", and these can be used as a foundation for new IDEs. The user interface can be switched  from classic MDI mode to the modern IDEAl mode, featuring a code-centric approach with on-demand tool-views. 
</P><P>
KDevelop features extensive support for navigating the source code. Symbols and filenames can be accessed by just typing part of the name, recently modified files can be reached with a simple keystroke. 
</P><P>
KDevelop offers documentation generators, code debugging, memory checking, code refactoring, bookmark management, and dozens of tools to make development easy and convenient. It is translated into more than 16 languages.
