KDevelop 3.1.x features</a> plus:<br>
<ul>

<li><b>New refactored codebase</b>
<ul>
<li>The KDevelop codebase has been refactored with the goal of improving code reuse and documenting the base library 
classes that compose KDevelop. These base classes form the new <em>KDevelop platform</em> and present a concise and well documented API</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><b>New RAD (<em>R</em>apid <em>A</em>pplication <em>D</em>evelopment) tools</b>
<ul>
<li>KDevDesigner integration enables GUI design from within KDevelop itself</li>
<li>KDevAssistent integration provides a feature rich documentation viewer from within KDevelop</li>
<li>The C++ Class Wizard can now be used for classes in the persistant class store. This means, for example,
that if the Code Completion database for Qt is built then subclassing from Qt classes is possible in the wizard</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><b>Much improved ruby language support</b>
<ul>
<li>New ruby debugger, combined with improved inspect methods in the 
qtruby/korundum bindings, for showing Qt::Object metadata such as properties, 
while debugging</li>
<li>Class browser has an improved parser that shows Qt and DCOP signals and 
slots, attr_accessor methods and instance variables</li>

Qt only apps</li>

</ul>
</li>

are back in 3.2, together with a much improved Subversion plugin.</li>
<li>Improved "Find in files", Ctags support and history navigation provide faster code navigation</li>
<li>More application templates are provided</li>
