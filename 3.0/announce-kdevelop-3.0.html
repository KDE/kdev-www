<H3 ALIGN="center">KDevelop 3.0 release Anouncement</H3>
<P><STRONG>The KDevelop Team Ships Major Feature Release of Award-Winning Open Source IDE</STRONG></P>
<P>February 03, 2004 (The INTERNET).
The KDevelop Team is proud to ship KDevelop 3.0, the first major release of the completely rewritten, award-winning Integrated Development Environment (IDE).
</P>
<P>
"KDevelop is a key to reaching brand new levels of productivity. It is an IDE suitable for every task from system programming to GUI RAD development. Integrating all standard UNIX development tools, providing support for team development with various version control system tools and having a large list of supported languages, KDevelop is an excellent choice for UNIX developers. Available on different platforms such as Mac OS X and Windows/Cygwin, KDevelop is a great tool for multiplatform development. Support for common development tools allows to develop applications for a large number of platforms including embedded platforms" said Alexander Dymo, project co-maintainer.
</P>
<P>
"With its new language-independent, plugin-based core and wide support for common development tools, KDevelop is already the de-facto standard IDE on Linux/Unix desktops" added Harald Fernengel, long-time project member.
</P>
<P>
"The KDevelop team did an excelent work with this release. Over 40 developers contributed over a timespan of 14 months to the project. You'll notice that care was taken in the documentation and in the user interface. This version is powerful, yet easy to use" noted Amilcar do Carmo Lucas, release co-coordinator.
</P>

<H4>Major Enhancements</H4>
<P>
KDevelop now supports over 15 programming languages and numerous version control systems, debuggers, documentation formats and build tools. Any Editor supporting the KTextEditor interfaces can be used as native KDevelop editor, including kate, QEditor and kvim. Build tools like automake, qmake or ant are supported natively, meaning that KDevelop does not maintain its own object repository. Changes in the native project files will be reflected in KDevelop and vice-versa.
</P><P>
The C++ support offers a class view showing all the symbols either flat or hierarchical by namespaces and allows easy code-navigation. A background parser updates the symbols on the fly and also shows syntactical errors in the source code. The code completion even deals with Qt signals and slots.
</P><P>
With its new open architecture, KDevelop can be customized in every respect. The user interface can be switched on the fly from classic MDI mode to the modern IDEAl mode, featuring a code-centric approach with on-demand tool-views.
</P><P>
KDevelop features extensive support for navigating the source code. Symbols and filenames can be accessed by just typing part of the name, recently modified files can be reached with a simple keystroke.
</P><P>
KDevelop offers documentation generators, code debugging, memory checking, code refactoring, bookmark management, and dozens of tools to make development easy and convenient. It is translated into more than 16 languages, ranging from English to Tamil.
</P>
