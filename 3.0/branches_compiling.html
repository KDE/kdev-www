<?php module_head("Instructions for a self-compiled version of KDevelop 3.0.x"); ?>
Get the sources for the <b>KDE_3_2_BRANCH</b> like is explained above.<br>
<br>
Before continuing please check if your computer has the
<a href="index.html?filename=3.0/requirements.html">required software</a> installed.<br>
<br>
Initialize the build system:
<pre>
       $ cd kdevelop
       $ make -f admin/Makefile.common cvs-clean
       $ make -f Makefile.cvs
</pre>
<?php
  include_file("3.0/compiling.ihtml");
  module_tail();
  module_head("How to keep your version up to date");
?>
<br>
After you downloaded and successfully compiled one of the CVS branches
above, you'll want to keep it up to date in order to get all the patches.
To avoid typing in all the statements that set the necessary environment
variables every time you update, you should set them in your .bashrc
or .cshrc file.<br>

If you use bash shell add the following lines:<br>

<pre>
export KDEDIR=/where/your/kde3/is
export QTDIR=/where/your/qt3/is
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$QTDIR/lib:$KDEDIR/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
export LIBRARY_PATH=$QTDIR/lib:$KDEDIR/lib:$LIBRARY_PATH
export PATH=$QTDIR/bin:$KDEDIR/bin:$PATH
</pre>

If you use tcsh add the following lines:<br>

<pre>
setenv KDEDIR /where/your/kde3/is
setenv QTDIR /where/your/qt3/is
setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH $QTDIR/lib:$KDEDIR/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
setenv LIBRARY_PATH $QTDIR/lib:$KDEDIR/lib:$LIBRARY_PATH
setenv PATH $QTDIR/bin:$KDEDIR/bin:$PATH
</pre>

<P>
<b>Note:</b> For obvious reasons you should edit the first two lines to match your configuration! :)<br>
</p>

<br>

Next go to the directory where you've put the <i>kdevelop from CVS</i> files and issue the update command:<br>

<pre>
 $ cd where_kde3src_is/kdevelop
 $ cvs update -dP
</pre>
<br>
The next step depends on the output of the previous command:<br>

If you got something like:<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;U /some_directory_path/Makefile.am<br>
You should do:<br>

<pre>
 $ make -f Makefile.cvs
</pre>

and then _ALL_ of the following steps.<br>

<br>
If you got something like:<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;P /some_directory_path/Makefile.am<br>
You should do:<br>

<pre>
 $ ./configure --enable-debug=full --prefix=$KDEDIR --with-kdelibsdoxy-dir=$KDEDIR/share/doc/HTML/en/kdelibs-apidocs
</pre>
and then _ALL_ of the following steps.<br><br>

<pre>
  $ make
  $ make install (as root)
</pre>
If for some reason the make command fails you can force it to ignore
errors by adding the -k option. Depending on the error gravity you might
end up with a working or non-working version of kdevelop. So do the "make
-k install" at your own risk!!!. Any way these errors usually go away after
a couple of hours so you might want to try an update again later before the
dangerous :) make install command.<br>

<pre>
 $ make -k
 $ make -k install (as root)
</pre>

That's it! You now have the most up to date version of KDevelop. To start it just do:<br>

<pre>
 $ kdevelop
</pre>

All you have to do to keep it up to date is to repeat these steps whenever
someone on the <a href="index.html?filename=mailinglist.html">kdevelop-devel</a>
mailing list fixes a bug. <br>
So you're strongly encouraged to <a href="index.html?filename=mailinglist.html">join
this mailing list</a>.<br><br><br>

You should report the bugs you find with the <a
href="http://bugs.kde.org/wizard.cgi">bug submition form</a>. You should <b>not</b> report
compilation errors to the bug database. For compilation errors use the
<a href="index.html?filename=mailinglist.html">mailing list</a> instead.<br>
<br>

You can take a look at the bugs in the <a
href="http://bugs.kde.org/buglist.cgi?product=kdevelop&amp;bug_status=UNCONFIRMED&amp;bug_status=NEW&amp;bug_status=ASSIGNED&amp;bug_status=REOPENED&amp;order=map_components.name,bugs.bug_id">bug
database</a>.<br>

<?php module_tail();
module_head("How to compile on FreeBSD"); ?><br>

Follow the normal instructions, but use gmake instead of make and after
<pre>
       $ gmake -f Makefile.cvs
</pre>
do:
<pre>
       $ export CXXFLAGS="-L/usr/X11R6/lib -I/usr/local/include/db41 -I/usr/local/include -L/usr/local/lib -I/usr/X11R6/include"
</pre>
Note that you need the berkeley db 4.1 installed, if you have another
version, you need to adjust the path.<br>
Change the line "ac_cv_bdb=no" to "ac_cv_bdb=yes" in the configure file because otherwise, configure can't find the db libraries.<br>
To see which version you have installed:
<pre>
       $ pkg_info | grep db41
       db41-4.1.25_1       The Berkeley DB package, revision 4.1
</pre>
The FreeBSD guys renamed libdb.so to libdbxx.so. So replace "-ldb" by "-ldb41" in lib/catalog/Makefile.am<br>
Then you can continue the normal process:
<pre>
       $ ./configure --prefix=/blah --enable-debug=full
</pre>

<?php module_tail(); ?>
