<a name="36"><b> Where do I get KDevelop? How do I install it?</b></a><br>
The KDevelop Team does not release any binary versions of KDevelop (RPMs).
RPMs can therefore be found on your distributor's server or in the corresponding subdirectories
of <a href="ftp://ftp.kde.org/pub/">ftp.kde.org</a> or one of its <a href="http://www.kde.org/ftpmirrors.html">mirrors</a><br>
Take a look at <a href="index.html?filename=3.0/download.html">our download site</a> for information about how to download and compile the source code.<br>
<br>
<br>
<a name="37"><b> Am I allowed to develop commercial applications with KDevelop?</b></a><br>
Everyone and all entities are free to use KDevelop. The generated Code
can be put under all licenses you wish. Therefore, the project generator
has the fields for adding your own copyright notice to the generated
files, but to make things simpler and to have an example, the default is
a GPL license notice. So you can add your license notice there.<br>

When it comes to actually editing etc. your program, using KDevelop is
just as using any other editor, it's a program that is GPL that is
intended for use and doesn't have any implications on what you use it
for. So you can write commercial/closed software with it despite the
fact that KDevelop itself is GPL.<br>

Towards using KDE functions or any other stuff of free software, you
only have to watch the licensing notes on the libraries you're going to
use. So for commercial development of KDE/Qt applications you only need
a professional license from Trolltech. The KDE libraries itself are LGPL
which means you can use the function calls and link your program to the
KDE libraries. This counts for the kdelibs libraries, the kdebase
libraries (konqueror and kcontrol etc.) and the koffice libraries (for
creating koffice apps).<br>
For more information, please visit <a href="1.3/doc/programming/index-16.html">
KDevelop Licensing</a><br>
<br>
<br>
<a name="137"><b> Am I allowed to develop commercial plugins to KDevelop?</b></a><br>
KDevelop includes a libkdeveloplgpl.so library to allow development of
commercial plugins. This library includes KDevelop interfaces and utility
functions released under LGPL. If you have a professional license from Trolltech
you can link your code with libkdeveloplgpl and release it under any license.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<a name="45"><b> I compiled and installed KDevelop 3.0 but all I see is a File and a Help Menu</b></a><br>
Just as any other KDE application, you have to make sure that KDevelop's plugins are recognized
by KDE. Either install it into your KDE directory (configure --prefix=/opt/kde3 for example) or
add KDevelop path to your KDEDIRS environment variable and rerun "kbuildsycoca".
Example command line for bash (assuming KDevelop is installed in /home/harry/kdevelop):<br>
<tt>export KDEDIRS=/home/harry/kdevelop:$KDEDIRS &amp;&amp; kbuildsycoca</tt><br>
<br>
<br>
<a name = "38"><b> How do I switch between opened files with the keyboard?</b></a><br>
You can use ALT-Left and ALT-Right to go to the previous/next opened file. Those keys can be configured in the KDevelop setup. There is also Quick Open (CTRL-SHIFT-O) function to select and open file in a project and Switch To (CTRL-/) function which allows to type first letters of a name of the opened file to switch to it.<br>
<br>
<br>
<a name = "39"><b>How can I enter text while debugging a console application?</b></a><br>
The GDB window allows typing your own commands.<br>
<br>
<br>
<a name = "40"><b>How can I enable code completion for external libraries?</b></a><br>
When you have any C/C++ project opened, go to menu <i>Project->Project Settings</i>, <i>in Project Options</i> dialog choose <i>C++ Specific tab</i>, then <i>Code Completion</i> tab. Push <i>Add Persistant Class Store</i> button and complete the <i>New Persistant Class Store</i> wizard. After completing the wizard, make sure that the newly created class store is checked in the list of persistant class stores at <i>Code Completion</i> tab.

<a name="3"><b> The configure script doesn't find my Qt library.</b></a><br>
   Use the options<br>
     --with-qt-includes=path_to_your_qt_includes<br>
   and<br>
     --with-qt-libraries=path_to_your_qt_library<br>
   or set the environment variable QTDIR to the path where Qt is installed<br>
   ( "export QTDIR=/path/to/qt" ).<br>

<br>
<a name="8"><b> Patching configure/Makefile/Makefile.in/config.h doesn't help, after starting autoconf/automake/autoheader my changes are lost.
   Where should I patch things?</b></a><br>
   There's a list of file, where you may patch things for the autotools.<br>
   Makefile.am, configure.in.in, configure.in (only if there is no configure.in.in)<br>
   [rarely used: acconfig.h, configure.in.mid, configure.in.bot]<br>
<br>
<br>
<a name="9"><b> I am developing an application where I need to set -D options to the preprocessor.<br>

   distribute my package, the -D options set in KDevelop are not used. What do I have<br>
   to do to make this work ?</b></a><br>
   Edit the file configure.in(.in) in your toplevel source directory. Here, you<br>
   have to enter after the AC_CHECK_COMPILERS macro:<br>
     CPPFLAGS="$CPPFLAGS -DMYDEFINE"<br>
   and after that you have to recreate your new "configure" by invoking<br>
   "make -f Makefile.dist" and then rerun the configure script.<br>
<br>
<br>
<a name="10"><b> Is there another possibility to publish my own defines?</b></a><br>
   Another version to include DEFINEs in your project is to publish<br>
   them by config.h.<br>
   To do so you have to patch the following files:<br>
   Add to acconfig.h of your toplevel project directory the following line:<br>
     #undef MYDEFINE<br>
<br>
   and insert in the configure.in(.in), after the macro call<br>
   AC_CONFIG_HEADER(config.h):<br>
     AC_DEFINE_UNQUOTED(MYDEFINE)<br>
<br>
   (So it will be defined in config.h after updating your framework with<br>
    "make -f Makefile.dist; configure [your options]".<br>
<br>
   Requirements for this solutions are:<br>
     AC_CONFIG_HEADER(config.h)<br>
   inside configure.in(.in) and in the sourcecode a<br>
     #ifdef HAVE_CONFIG_H<br>
     #include &#060;config.h&#062;<br>
     #endif<br>
   before the other includes will be done<br>
   (normally this is already done in our project templates).<br>
<br>
   BTW: An advantage of this solution is to make MYDEFINE dependable on<br>
        certain situations (like creating an option for configure).<br>
        This needs of course writing an own macro function.<br>
<br>
<br>
<a name="11"><b> I am developing an application which needs exception handling.<br>
   How can I make it?</b></a><br>
   Edit the file configure.in(.in) in your toplevel source directory. Here, you<br>
   have to enter after the AC_CHECK_COMPILERS() macro:<br>
     CXXFLAGS="$CXXFLAGS $USE_EXCEPTIONS"<br>
   and after that you have to recreate your new "configure" by invoking<br>
   "make -f Makefile.dist" at the toplevel source directory and then restart<br>
   the configure script.<br>
<br>
<br>
<a name="12"><b> My configure.in.in hasn't any AC_CHECK_COMPILERS() call. Where should I put the<br>
     CXXFLAGS="$CXXFLAGS $USE_EXCEPTIONS"<br>
   mentioned above?</b></a><br>
   The new versions of configure.in.in has been simplified you can now add the line<br>
   after the AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE(&#060;package-name&#062;,&#060;version&#062;).<br>
<br>
<br>
<a name="13"><b> I am developing an application which needs run-time-type-info compiled within.<br>
   How can I make it?</b></a><br>
   Edit the file configure.in(.in) in your toplevel source directory. Here, you<br>
   have to enter after the AC_CHECK_COMPILERS macro:<br>
     CXXFLAGS="$CXXFLAGS $USE_RTTI"<br>
   and after that you have to recreate your new "configure" by invoking<br>
   "make -f Makefile.dist" at the toplevel source directory and then restart<br>
   the configure script.<br>
<br>
<br>
<a name="16"><b> The solutions above are nice, but I want this only for a certain subdirectory<br>
   (e.g. a static lib of my project)<br>
   How can I make it?</b></a><br>
   Edit the file Makefile.am in the desired source directory. Here, you<br>
   have to enter somewhere outside the KDevelop specific part:<br>
     KDE_CXXFLAGS=$(USE_EXCEPTIONS)<br>
   Take care this works only if your project is using am_edit.<br>
   (It works only for newer acinclude.m4 &amp; am_edit, AFAWK they must be<br>
    younger than 12-09-1999, formerly it was known as APPEND_CXXFLAGS -<br>
    in this KDevelop release you will find the right once.)<br>
<br>
   You have to update your Makefile-framework as described above<br>
   (make -f Makefile.dist; ./configure [options]).<br>
<br>
<br>
<a name="17"><b> What is the difference between CPPFLAGS and CXXFLAGS?</b></a><br>
   CPPFLAGS is used for defines (means flags you need only for compiling)<br>
   CXXFLAGS is used for compiler switches (e.g. -frtti), which apply also<br>
   in the linking process.<br>
<br>
<br>
<a name="18"><b> I have seen some solutions like patching Makefile.am with<br>
     DEFS+=-DMYDEFINE<br>
   or<br>
     CXXFLAGS+=-fsigned-char<br>
   or<br>
     LD_FLAGS+=-L/usr/local/lib<br>
   Why don't you consider this?</b></a><br>
   There is a bug inside automake 1.4, which doesn't add flags to the already<br>
   existing one. With this command inside Makefile.am, you would delete the existing<br>
   settings of the named flag.<br>
   If you want these flags only for the project subdirectory use:<br>
     AM_CPPFLAGS=-DMYDEFINE<br>
   or<br>
     AM_CXXFLAGS=-fsigned-char<br>
   or<br>
     AM_LDFLAGS=-L/usr/local/lib<br>
<br>
   Take care, these flags are only published by automake version 1.4.<br>
<br>
   For setting one of these flags for the whole project, please patch the<br>
   configure.in(.in) in the toplevel source directory instead.<br>
<br>
<br>
<a name="19"><b> How can I guarantee that a user of my project will build it with automake<br>
   version 1.4?</b></a><br>
   Add to the AUTOMAKE_OPTIONS variable at the Makefile.am of the toplevel<br>
   source directory the string "1.4". E.g.:<br>
   AUTOMAKE_OPTIONS = foreign 1.4<br>
<br>
<br>
<a name="59"><b> I added an existing subproject to my project and it doesn't build anymore.</b></a><br>
  This can happen if builddir != topsrcdir. In this case run make distclean before<br>
adding the subproject.<br>
<br>
<br>
<a name="20"><b> Can AM_CXXFLAGS (inside a Makefile.am) be used for flags like -frtti or<br>
   -fexceptions?</b></a><br>
   No! In these cases there is an ordering problem. The standard CXXFLAGS variable<br>
   published by acinclude.m4.in already contains a -fno-rtti (-fno_exceptions).<br>
   If you did apply it to AM_CXXFLAGS the compiler command would insert<br>
   these flags before the CXXFLAGS, e.g. here for -frtti:<br>
   gpp ... -frtti ... -fno-exceptions -fno-rtti ......<br>
   So the last flag (in this case, still -fno-rtti) will be used.<br>
   KDE_CXXFLAGS instead will be inserted after the standard CXXFLAGS, so it<br>
   would look like:<br>
   gpp ..... -fno-exceptions -fno-rtti ...... -frtti...<br>
   and voilà it works fine.<br>
<br>
   Take care: KDE_CXXFLAGS are only published by projects, which use am_edit<br>
   and acinclude.m4.<br>
<br>
<br>
<a name="21"><b> Why patching configure.in(.in) with CXXFLAGS="$USE_EXCEPTIONS $CXXFLAGS" doesn't work?</b></a><br>
   Look at the answer to the question "Can AM_CXXFLAGS (inside a Makefile.am)<br>
   be used for flags like -frtti or -fexceptions?" ;-)<br>
<br>
<br>
<a name="22"><b> I am using CXXFLAGS="$USE_EXCEPTIONS" inside configure.in(.in) and it works fine,<br>
   why should I use your solution?</b></a><br>
   If you would use your version before AC_CHECK_COMPILERS() a call like<br>
     CXXFLAGS="-pedantic" ./configure<br>
   wouldn't work correctly.<br>
   If you did use it after AC_CHECK_COMPILERS() the CXXFLAGS set in<br>
   AC_CHECK_COMPILERS() would be cleared.<br>
   (For example in a "configure --enable-debug" call CXXFLAGS would be<br>
    changed to insert also debug information to your code.)<br>
   So please use CXXFLAGS="$CXXFLAGS $USE_EXCEPTIONS" instead.<br>
<br>
<br>
<a name="23"><b> I'm using additional headers and libs for my KDE/QT project. Putting<br>
   -I/usr/include/foo in the compiler options and -L/usr/lib/foo to the<br>
   linker options won't distribute the settings into the tarball.<br>
   What do I have to do?</b></a><br>
   This is the most difficult part to do it the right way.<br>
   An easy, but not correct solution would be to add to the configure.in(.in):<br>
<br>
   all_includes="$all_includes -I/usr/include/foo"<br>
   all_libraries="$all_libraries -L/usr/lib/foo"<br>
<br>
   [the best place for that is before the lines:<br>
    AC_ARG_PROGRAM<br>
    AC_OUTPUT( ..... )<br>
    at the end of the file.]<br>
<br>
   Problems here:<br>
   - Who can guarantee that the includes would always be in<br>
     /usr/include/foo... maybe on some systems it could be in /usr/local/foo/include<br>
     (and maybe the libs would be there in /usr/local/foo/lib)??<br>
   - Maybe I haven't installed the foo-stuff so building would fail, but it would be<br>
     better if configure did already fail with a more helpful message.<br>
<br>
   So to make it right you would have to add a macro function to<br>
   configure.in(.in), which do certain tests and searches for an installed "foo".<br>
<br>
   If you want to do so, we can give you here only a hint... try to<br>
   understand the acinclude.m4.in or create a KDE-normal-ogl project,<br>
   there you find a file called qgl.m4, which will be concatenated to<br>
   acinclude.m4 (see "Makefile.dist"). This shows you an extensive example<br>
   to search for QT-OpenGL-Lib, you have to rewrite it for your problem.<br>
<br>
   Maybe you have luck and find already a solution for your problem inside<br>
   acinclude.m4.in, so you could use an already created function.<br>
<br>
<br>
<a name="25"><b> In the questions above I always see "configure.in(.in)". I have both files in my<br>
   project. Which file should be patched?</b></a><br>
   If there is a configure.in.in in your top-level project directory patch this one.<br>
   If you didn't find a configure.in.in patch configure.in.<br>
<br>
<br>
<a name="28"><b> Is there any HOWTO available on how to work with QT designer made dialogs ?</b></a><br>
  Yes, there is a great tutorial on <a href="http://women.kde.org/articles/tutorials/kdevelop3/index.html">http://women.kde.org/articles/tutorials/kdevelop3/index.html</a><br>
<br>
<br>
<a name="29"><b> I have installed htdig but there is now htsearch available ?</b></a><br>
   On e.g. RedHat systems the htsearch executable is placed in the /cgi-bin dir of apache.<br>
   You can create symlinks in /usr/bin or simply add this path ro ~/.bashrc<br>
<br>
<br>
<a name="30"><b> I have htdig, htmerge and htsearch available but I get an error message that the config file of htdig could not be found or is invalid ?</b></a><br>
   Read README.htdig in the source directory tree and create a htdig.conf file. Then copy<br>
   it to $KDEDIR/share/apps/kdevelop/tools. Now create your search index with the kdevelop<br>
