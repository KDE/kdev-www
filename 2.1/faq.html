<a name="37"><b> Am I allowed to develop commercial applications with KDevelop?</b></a><br>
Everyone and all entities are free to use KDevelop. The generated Code
can be put under all licenses you wish. Therefore, the project generator
has the fields for adding your own copyright notice to the generated
files, but to make things simpler and to have an example, the default is
a GPL license notice. So you can add your license notice there.<br>

When it comes to actually editing etc. your program, using KDevelop is
just as using any other editor, it's a program that is GPL that is
intended for use and doesn't have any implications on what you use it
for. So you can write commercial/closed software with it despite the
fact that KDevelop itself is GPL.<br>

Towards using KDE functions or any other stuff of free software, you
only have to watch the licensing notes on the libraries you're going to
use. So for commercial development of KDE/Qt applications you only need
a professional license from Trolltech. The KDE libraries itself are LGPL
which means you can use the function calls and link your program to the
KDE libraries. This counts for the kdelibs libraries, the kdebase
libraries (konqueror and kcontrol etc.) and the koffice libraries (for
creating koffice apps).<br>

<br>
<a name="36"><b> Where do I get KDevelop? How do I install it?</b></a><br>
The KDevelop Team does not release any binary versions of KDevelop (RPMs).
RPMs can therefore be found on your distributor's server or in the corresponding subdirectories
of <a href="ftp://ftp.kde.org/pub/">ftp.kde.org</a> or one of its
<a href="http://www.kde.org/ftpmirrors.html">mirrors</a><br>
Take a look at <a href="index.html?filename=2.1/kdevelop.html#Downloads">our download page</a>
for information about how to download and compile the source code.<br>
<br>
<br>
<a name="1"><b> I am running SuSE 7.3 and new projects fail to build</b></a><br>
   The autoconf version shipped with SuSE 7.3 doesn't work with<br>
   KDevelop 2.0. Either update KDevelop or downgrade your autoconf as<br>
   described in <a href="http://sdb.suse.de/en/sdb/html/kdevelop_autoconf_73.html">http://sdb.suse.de/en/sdb/html/kdevelop_autoconf_73.html</a><br>
<br>
<br>
<a name="2"><b> I am running Red Hat 7.x and I'm getting weird characters in the output pane</b></a><br>
  This is an error in the Red Hat packages, update KDevelop to a recent version.<br>
<br>
<br>
<a name="35"><b> Opening a file takes forever</b></a><br>
This is a known problem with the KDE/Qt Clipboard using Qt 2.3.2. Some users reported that it helps to shut down Klipper, the clipboard tool.<br>
Unfortunately, we do not yet have a real workaround yet other than installing KDE3 or downgrading to Qt 2.3.1.<br>
<br>
<br>
<a name = "38"><b> How do I switch between opened files with the keyboard?</b></a><br>
You can either use CTRL-1 to CTRL-0 to switch between the first ten files or ALT-PageUp and ALT-PageDown to go to the previous/next opened file. Those keys can be configured in the KDevelop setup.<br>
<br>
<br>
<a name = "39"><b> How can I enter text while debugging a console application?</b></a><br>
The StdOut Window is read-only, you have to enable a separate console by checking <i>Options-&gt;KDevelop Setup-&gt;Debugger-&gt;Enable separate terminal for application i/o</i><br>
<br>
<br>
<a name="40"><b>KDevelop 2.x tries to open the wrong file when I click on an error message</b></a><br>
Please set your system language to English or upgrade your KDevelop version to 2.1.1 or greater<br>
Quick workaround (for bash users): <i>export LANG=C &amp;&amp; kdevelop</i><br>
<br>
<br>
<a name="41"><b>After creating a new project, KDevelop crashes</b></a><br>
if the backtrace contains <i>in QCommonStyle::drawControl ()</i> then please upgrade
Qt or use the KDE default style.<br>
<br>
<br>
<a name="3"><b> The configure script doesn't find my Qt library.</b></a><br>
   Use the options<br>
     --with-qt-includes=path_to_your_qt_includes<br>
   and<br>
     --with-qt-libraries=path_to_your_qt_library<br>
   or set the environment variable QTDIR to the path where Qt is installed<br>
   ( "export QTDIR=/path/to/qt" ).<br>
<br>
<br>
<a name="4"><b> I get the message: "Wrong JPEG library version: library is 61, caller expects 62 "</b></a><br>
  There are 2 ways.<br>
<br>
   1: When the kdelibs are installed it installs header files for the<br>
      jpeg libraries, these are version 61,  however most distributions<br>
      (Redhat) use version 62 libraries. To fix  this just remove jpeglib.h<br>
      from /opt/kde/include. The pukka include  file for version 62 should<br>
      then be picked up. However looking at the  error message above it may<br>
      be the other way round, in any case ensure  you only have on version<br>
      of the header file, the library and that  they are consistent.<br>
<br>
      It is useful to use the locate command to verify that I have<br>
      the correct version of a library and header files e.g.<br>
      updatedb<br>
      locate libjpeg<br>
      locate jpeglib<br>
<br>
   2: You must recompiled kdesupport without jpeg<br>
      library (configure --with-libjpeg --with-libgif).<br>
<br>

   There's a list of file, where you may patch things for the autotools.<br>

   [rarely used: acconfig.h, configure.in.mid, configure.in.bot]<br>

   to do to make this work ?</b></a><br>
   Edit the file configure.in(.in) in your toplevel source directory. Here, you<br>
   have to enter after the AC_CHECK_COMPILERS macro:<br>
     CPPFLAGS="$CPPFLAGS -DMYDEFINE"<br>
   and after that you have to recreate your new "configure" by invoking<br>
   "make -f Makefile.dist" and then rerun the configure script<br>
   (or inside KDevelop by using "Build/Autoconf and Automake" and "Build/Configure...").<br>
<br>
<br>
<a name="10"><b> Is there another possibility to publish my own defines?</b></a><br>
   Another version to include DEFINEs in your project is to publish<br>
   them by config.h.<br>
   To do so you have to patch the following files:<br>
   Add to acconfig.h of your toplevel project directory the following line:<br>
     #undef MYDEFINE<br>
<br>
   and insert in the configure.in(.in), after the macro call<br>
   AC_CONFIG_HEADER(config.h):<br>
     AC_DEFINE_UNQUOTED(MYDEFINE)<br>
<br>
   (So it will be defined in config.h after updating your framework with<br>
    "make -f Makefile.dist; configure [your options]"<br>
    or inside KDevelop by using "Build/Autoconf and Automake" and "Build/Configure...").<br>
<br>
   Requirements for this solutions are:<br>
     AC_CONFIG_HEADER(config.h)<br>
   inside configure.in(.in) and in the sourcecode a<br>
     #ifdef HAVE_CONFIG_H<br>
     #include &#060;config.h&#062;<br>
     #endif<br>
   before the other includes will be done<br>
   (normally this is already done in our project templates).<br>
<br>
   BTW: An advantage of this solution is to make MYDEFINE dependable on<br>
        certain situations (like creating an option for configure).<br>
        This needs of course writing an own macro function.<br>
<br>
<br>
<a name="11"><b> I am developing an application which needs exception handling.<br>
   How can I make it?</b></a><br>
   Edit the file configure.in(.in) in your toplevel source directory. Here, you<br>
   have to enter after the AC_CHECK_COMPILERS() macro:<br>
     CXXFLAGS="$CXXFLAGS $USE_EXCEPTIONS"<br>
   and after that you have to recreate your new "configure" by invoking<br>
   "make -f Makefile.dist" at the toplevel source directory and then restart<br>
   the configure script<br>
   (or inside KDevelop by using "Build/Autoconf and Automake" and "Build/Configure...").<br>
<br>
<br>
<a name="12"><b> My configure.in.in hasn't any AC_CHECK_COMPILERS() call. Where should I put the<br>
     CXXFLAGS="$CXXFLAGS $USE_EXCEPTIONS"<br>
   mentioned above?</b></a><br>
   The new versions of configure.in.in has been simplified you can now add the line<br>
   after the AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE(&#060;package-name&#062;,&#060;version&#062;).<br>

<a name="13"><b> I am developing an application which needs run-time-type-info compiled within.<br>

   *** OBSOLETE for new project templates ***<br>
   Edit the file configure.in(.in) in your toplevel source directory. Here, you<br>
   have to enter after the AC_CHECK_COMPILERS macro:<br>
     CXXFLAGS="$CXXFLAGS $USE_RTTI"<br>
   and after that you have to recreate your new "configure" by invoking<br>
   "make -f Makefile.dist" at the toplevel source directory and then restart<br>
   the configure script<br>
   (or inside KDevelop by using "Build/Autoconf and Automake" and "Build/Configure...").<br>
<br>
<br>
<a name="14"><b> Why $USE_RTTI isn't used anymore?</b></a><br>
   On the new templates -frtti is activated by default.<br>
<br>
<br>
<a name="15"><b> Are there some problems with using rtti on?</b></a><br>
   There are some problems with dlopening a module and using rtti on the<br>
   objects defined inside that module.<br>
<br>
<br>
<a name="16"><b> The solutions above are nice, but I want this only for a certain subdirectory<br>
   (e.g. a static lib of my project)<br>
   How can I make it?</b></a><br>
   Edit the file Makefile.am in the desired source directory. Here, you<br>
   have to enter somewhere outside the KDevelop specific part:<br>
     KDE_CXXFLAGS=$(USE_EXCEPTIONS)<br>
   Take care this works only if your project is using am_edit.<br>
   (It works only for newer acinclude.m4 &amp; am_edit, AFAWK they must be<br>
    younger than 12-09-1999, formerly it was known as APPEND_CXXFLAGS -<br>
    in this KDevelop release you will find the right once.)<br>
<br>
   You have to update your Makefile-framework as described above<br>
   (make -f Makefile.dist; ./configure [options] or<br>
    inside KDevelop by using "Build/Autoconf and Automake" and "Build/Configure...").<br>
<br>
<br>
<a name="17"><b> What is the difference between CPPFLAGS and CXXFLAGS?</b></a><br>
   CPPFLAGS is used for defines (means flags you need only for compiling)<br>
   CXXFLAGS is used for compiler switches (e.g. -frtti), which apply also<br>
   in the linking process.<br>
<br>
<br>
<a name="18"><b> I have seen some solutions like patching Makefile.am with<br>
     DEFS+=-DMYDEFINE<br>
   or<br>
     CXXFLAGS+=-fsigned-char<br>
   or<br>
     LD_FLAGS+=-L/usr/local/lib<br>
   Why don't you consider this?</b></a><br>
   There is a bug inside automake 1.4, which doesn't add flags to the already<br>
   existing one. With this command inside Makefile.am, you would delete the existing<br>
   settings of the named flag.<br>
   If you want these flags only for the project subdirectory use:<br>
     AM_CPPFLAGS=-DMYDEFINE<br>
   or<br>
     AM_CXXFLAGS=-fsigned-char<br>
   or<br>
     AM_LDFLAGS=-L/usr/local/lib<br>
<br>
   Take care, these flags are only published by automake version 1.4.<br>
<br>
   For setting one of these flags for the whole project, please patch the<br>
   configure.in(.in) in the toplevel source directory instead.<br>
<br>
<br>
<a name="19"><b> How can I guarantee that a user of my project will build it with automake<br>
   version 1.4?</b></a><br>
   Add to the AUTOMAKE_OPTIONS variable at the Makefile.am of the toplevel<br>
   source directory the string "1.4". E.g.:<br>
   AUTOMAKE_OPTIONS = foreign 1.4<br>
<br>
<br>
<a name="20"><b> Can AM_CXXFLAGS (inside a Makefile.am) be used for flags like -frtti or<br>
   -fexceptions?</b></a><br>
   No! In these cases there is an ordering problem. The standard CXXFLAGS variable<br>
   published by acinclude.m4.in already contains a -fno-rtti (-fno_exceptions).<br>
   If you did apply it to AM_CXXFLAGS the compiler command would insert<br>
   these flags before the CXXFLAGS, e.g. here for -frtti:<br>
   gpp ... -frtti ... -fno-exceptions -fno-rtti ......<br>
   So the last flag (in this case, still -fno-rtti) will be used.<br>
   KDE_CXXFLAGS instead will be inserted after the standard CXXFLAGS, so it<br>
   would look like:<br>
   gpp ..... -fno-exceptions -fno-rtti ...... -frtti...<br>
   and voil� it works fine.<br>
<br>
   Take care: KDE_CXXFLAGS are only published by projects, which use am_edit<br>
   and acinclude.m4.<br>
<br>
<br>
<a name="21"><b> Why patching configure.in(.in) with CXXFLAGS="$USE_EXCEPTIONS $CXXFLAGS" doesn't work?</b></a><br>
   Look at the answer to the question "Can AM_CXXFLAGS (inside a Makefile.am)<br>
   be used for flags like -frtti or -fexceptions?" ;-)<br>
<br>
<br>
<a name="22"><b> I am using CXXFLAGS="$USE_EXCEPTIONS" inside configure.in(.in) and it works fine,<br>
   why should I use your solution?</b></a><br>
   If you would use your version before AC_CHECK_COMPILERS() a call like<br>
     CXXFLAGS="-pedantic" ./configure<br>
   wouldn't work correctly.<br>
   If you did use it after AC_CHECK_COMPILERS() the CXXFLAGS set in<br>
   AC_CHECK_COMPILERS() would be cleared.<br>
   (For example in a "configure --enable-debug" call CXXFLAGS would be<br>
    changed to insert also debug information to your code.)<br>
   So please use CXXFLAGS="$CXXFLAGS $USE_EXCEPTIONS" instead.<br>
<br>
<br>
<a name="23"><b> I'm using additional headers and libs for my KDE/QT project. Putting<br>
   -I/usr/include/foo in the compiler options and -L/usr/lib/foo to the<br>
   linker options won't distribute the settings into the tarball.<br>
   What do I have to do?</b></a><br>
   This is the most difficult part to do it the right way.<br>
   An easy, but not correct solution would be to add to the configure.in(.in):<br>
<br>
   all_includes="$all_includes -I/usr/include/foo"<br>
   all_libraries="$all_libraries -L/usr/lib/foo"<br>
<br>
   [the best place for that is before the lines:<br>
    AC_ARG_PROGRAM<br>
    AC_OUTPUT( ..... )<br>
    at the end of the file.]<br>
<br>
   Problems here:<br>
   - Who can guarantee that the includes would always be in<br>
     /usr/include/foo... maybe on some systems it could be in /usr/local/foo/include<br>
     (and maybe the libs would be there in /usr/local/foo/lib)??<br>
   - Maybe I haven't installed the foo-stuff so building would fail, but it would be<br>
     better if configure did already fail with a more helpful message.<br>
<br>
   So to make it right you would have to add a macro function to<br>
   configure.in(.in), which do certain tests and searches for an installed "foo".<br>
<br>
   If you want to do so, we can give you here only a hint... try to<br>
   understand the acinclude.m4.in or create a KDE-normal-ogl project,<br>
   there you find a file called qgl.m4, which will be concatenated to<br>
   acinclude.m4 (see "Makefile.dist"). This shows you an extensive example<br>
   to search for QT-OpenGL-Lib, you have to rewrite it for your problem.<br>
<br>
   Maybe you have luck and find already a solution for your problem inside<br>
   acinclude.m4.in, so you could use an already created function.<br>

   The only thing you have to do patch configure.in(.in):<br>
<br>
   all_includes="$all_includes -I/usr/include/foo"<br>
   all_libraries="$all_libraries -L/usr/lib/foo"<br>
   AC_SUBST(all_includes)<br>
   AC_SUBST(all_libraries)<br>
<br>
   and add the following lines to the Makefile.am of the sources' directory<br>
   (e.g. for project "test_cpp" this would be "test_cpp/test_cpp/Makefile.am"):<br>
<br>
   --- snip ---<br>
   # the include search path.<br>
   INCLUDES= $(all_includes)<br>
   # the library search path.<br>
   &#060;binary_name&#062;_LDFLAGS = $(all_libraries)<br>
   --- snap ---<br>
   (Substitute &#060;binary_name&#062; with the real binary name (e.g. test_cpp) and<br>
    the additions should be done outside the KDevelop specific section of the Makefile.am.)<br>
<br>
   After that, don�t forget to update configure and all Makefiles.<br>
   (Inside KDevelop by using "Build/Autoconf and Automake" and "Build/Configure...").<br>
<br>
<br>
<a name="25"><b> In the questions above I always see "configure.in(.in)". I have both files in my<br>
   project. Which file should be patched?</b></a><br>
   If there is a configure.in.in in your top-level project directory patch this one.<br>
   If you didn't find a configure.in.in patch configure.in.<br>
<br>
<br>
<a name="26"><b> I have downloaded the QT-2.2.x packages from ftp.kde.org and there are now KDE<br>
   widgets available in the designer. How can I get them ?</b></a><br>
   You have to recompile QT with ./configure -kde as additional option. Remember to set<br>
   $KDEDIR and $QTDIR to the appropriate directories. After doing so you have an option<br>
   KDE in the tools menue of the designer.<br>
<br>
<br>
<a name="27"><b> I use RedHat Linux with KDevelop and tried to recompile the QT library with -kde in<br>
   order to use the designer with KDE widget support but  during configure it says that<br>
   $KDEDIR does not contain a valid KDE installation ?</b></a><br>
   RedHat uses a non-standard directory setting with KDE. The normal case would be that<br>
   the libs are in $KDEDIR/lib, binaries in $KDEDIR/bin and includes in $KDEDIR/include.<br>
   RedHat uses /usr as $KDEDIR but $KDEDIR/include/kde as directory for  header files.<br>
   Therefore configure from QT fails to detect the correct directories. It searches dcopserver<br>
   in the binaries folder and the header files in their folder. So if you choose $KDEDIR to be<br>
   /usr, configure can't find the includes. A possible solution for this is to create a /usr/local/kde<br>
   directory and set symlinks to /usr/bin and /usr/include/kde in this "pseudo" kde dir.<br>
   Then export KDEDIR=/usr/local/kde and do the ./configure -kde. After compiling QT you have<br>
   the KDE entries in the tools menu of the QT designer.<br>
<br>
<br>
<a name="28"><b> Is there any HOWTO available on how to work with QT designer made dialogs ?</b></a><br>
   Yes, there is a great tutorial on <a href="http://women.kde.org/articles/tutorials.php">http://women.kde.org/articles/tutorials.php</a><br>
<br>
<br>
<a name="29"><b> I have installed htdig but there is now htsearch available ?</b></a><br>
   On e.g. RedHat systems the htsearch executable is placed in the /cgi-bin dir of apache.<br>
   You can create symlinks in /usr/bin or simply add this path ro ~/.bashrc<br>
<br>
<br>
<a name="30"><b> I have htdig, htmerge and htsearch available but I get an error message that the config file of htdig could not be found or is invalid ?</b></a><br>
   Read README.htdig in the source directory tree and create a htdig.conf file. Then copy<br>
   it to $KDEDIR/share/apps/kdevelop/tools. Now create your search index with the kdevelop<br>
   setup menu.<br>
<br>
<br>
<a name="31"><b> How do I change my project framework (aka autotool-project-files) to compile it for KDE/QT version 3<br>
   after project creation?</b></a><br>
   With the actual admin/-content it is possible to select the kde version by changing one line inside<br>
   configure.in.in:<br>
   #MIN_CONFIG<br>
   for the recent qt/kde version<br>
   #MIN_CONFIG(3)<br>
   for the recent qt/kde 3 version<br>
   #MIN_CONFIG(2)<br>
   for the last known qt/kde 2 version (i.e. QT 2.2.2)<br>
   #MIN_CONFIG(2.2)<br>
   for at least kde/qt version 2.2<br>
   #MIN_CONFIG(2.0)<br>
   for at least kde/qt version 2.0.2<br>
<br>
   On QT projects this can be also done by searching the line:<br>
   KDE_USE_QT(2) inside configure.in and change this to<br>
   KDE_USE_QT or revert this to a comment, for QT 3.x usage.<br>
<br>
<br>
<a name="32"><b> I have changed my project like above to develop for another KDE/QT version, but configure still<br>
   uses the wrong kde directories, what has to be done?</b></a><br>
   If you want to develop for another kde/qt version, you have to give configure the correct paths,<br>
   like e.g.<br>
   ./configure --with-qt-dir=/usr/lib/qt3<br>
   ./configure --prefix=/opt/kde2 --with-qt-dir=/usr/local/qt2<br>
   You must have installed the desired qt/kde version on your system.<br>
<br>
<br>
<a name="33"><b> I have two KDE versions on my system. If I try to create a KDE 2 project on KDevelop 2.1 (made for<br>
   KDE 2) a configure-call without parameters always uses /opt/kde3 (or /opt/kde) instead of /opt/kde2.<br>
   What's wrong?</b></a><br>
   Please check first your actual KDEDIR environment variable. In some cases it still points to<br>
   the wrong directory (e.g. ~/.profile, ~/.bashrc, /etc/profile).<br>
   Check also the KDE startscript (e.g. "/opt/kde2/bin/startkde"), because certain distributions<br>
   (like SuSE) are exporting another KDEDIR.<br>
   [the first configure-call inside the application wizard (after pressing "Create") shows you the<br>
    actual environment values of KDEDIR and QTDIR]<br>
   Another solution is to use always --prefix= option within the configure call. This can be set<br>
   with KDevelop inside "Options->KDevelop Setup->Path->KDE/QT Pathes"<br>
   (or Project->Project Options->Compiler Options/Configure").<br>
<br>
<br>
<a name="34"><b> I've done so, but the configure call still uses the wrong directory?</b></a><br>
   Now you have to "DistClean" (i.e. either "Project->DistClean" from within KDevelop or<br>
   "make distclean" from console) your project.
