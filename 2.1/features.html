<?php module_head("KDevelop 2.x features");?>

<h4>Project Management:</h4>
The project file keeps all information for your project files like file properties
(include or exclude from distribution), and projects can be created and changed individually.
The generated projects are autoconf/automake-compatible. 

<h4>Dialog Editor:</h4>
KDevelop provides you an easy way to create GUI interfaces with the built-in dialog editor.
You can let KDevelop generate the dialog sourcecode and get full control of the dialog functionality.

<h4>Classparser / Classtools:</h4>
The classview currently features the parsing of almost any C++ and C statement, nested classes,
structures within classes and operators as well as namespaces. It is also possible to add methods and 
attributes using the classtools dialogs. The classtool is a new feature of kdevelop. The idea is that you 
generally want a tool to view inheritance and methods that are usable through inheritance.
This need is fulfilled with the classtool. It's an intuitive way to browse the classes
in the system and to view their relationship. 

<h4>Integrated Debugger:</h4>
With KDevelop 1.1 you are provided a complete integrated debugger which lets you use KDevelop´s classviewer 
even more efficently when debugging as you can easily access the sourcecode to set breakpoints and watch 
variables of your application.
 
<h4>Graphical Class Viewer:</h4>
The graphical class viewer offers you the possibility to get an overview of your project
and all of your classes. 

<h4>Application Wizard:</h4>
The KAppWizard offers the generation of different application frameworks to create new programs.
Available are a standard KDE application with menubar, toolbar and statusbar, a mini-KDE-application
with an empty Mainwindow, a complete GNOME application, a Qt-only based application also with menubar, toolbar and statusbar
and finally a C/C++ Terminal application type. KDevelop 1.1 even incudes KDE 2/Qt 2 frameworks for those 
developers that want to stay on the bleeding edge of KDE development.  All of those are generated and adapted
to your new application's needs and are ready to run within seconds.

<h4>Documentation:</h4>
KDevelop ships with a complete documentation set which consists of five handbooks: The user manual, 
programming handbook, tutorial handbook and KDE library reference guides. This documentation plus a C/C++ reference 
and the Qt and KDE documentation can be easily accessed by the integrated documentation browser. 

<h4>Four Treeviews:</h4>
The treeviews allow to easily switch between source/headerfiles, classes and documentation which enables 
you to manage your project files without using an external filemanager. 

<h4>Integrated Editor:</h4>
Full featured editor with syntax highlighting. (KWrite) 

<h4>Integrated Unix tools for development:</h4>
We integrated a lot of features which we thought could be very useful. Also during testing
KDevelop we had new ideas on making routine work simple and so tried to implement those ideas
as well. To mention are kdoc, kiconedit, kdbg, automake & friends etc.

<h4>Integrated Documentation Browser:</h4>
The documentation browser offers direct access to the current documentation of the Qt and KDE libraries, the 
KDevelop manuals and tutorials. With the help of the documentation tree, you can browse directly to the 
documentation for any KDE/Qt class or method.
 
<h4>Powerful Help System:</h4>
The help system provides Quickhelp messages, "What's this" and statusbar help anywhere, so you always get
feedback about where you are and what you can do.
 
<h4>Class Generator:</h4>
Creates your classes on the fly. 

<h4>3 MDI visualization modes in a choice:</h4>
Let KDevelop's user interface look like MS Visual C++, Borland Builder, KDEStudio or like Gimp.
Dock the views as you want to. It allows:<br>

<ul>
<li>to open as many source files as you want</li>
<li>to open as many documentation browser files as you want</li>
<li>to open multiple views on one source file.</li>
<li>to work in the user interface mode of your choice. You can switch
  between these ones:<br>
   1. Every single view is a toplevel window on desktop. Even the tool
      views (trees and output). Addionally, there's a control window
      containing the bars and menus. Like in Gimp.<br>
   2. Childframe MDI mode like in MS Visual C++.<br>
   3. TabPage MDI mode like in KDEStudio or Borland Builder</li>
<li>to use an application-owned taskbar for the opened views
  (but of course, you can switch that off)</li>
<li>to work with full floatable tool views</li>
</ul>

This is the default user interface, a scenario which somehow looks like
MSVC ;-). Note the view-taskbar at the bottom. And furthermore, do you
see the little "undock" button in the upper right corner of the window
(next to the minimize button of the editor view)? If you click on it,
the editor view will undock to desktop and it becomes toplevel.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD><a href="graphics/screenshots/2.1/kdev2.0-pict2.jpg" target=new><img src="graphics/screenshots/2.1/kdev2.0-pict2_small.jpg" alt="TabPage MDI mode"></a></TD><TD>
This is TabPage MDI mode. Statistically it seems it's the most often used mode.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><a href="graphics/screenshots/2.1/kdev2.0-pict3.jpg" target=new><img src="graphics/screenshots/2.1/kdev2.0-pict3_small.jpg" alt="toplevel mode mode"></a></TD><TD>
I suppose, most Unix users are used to work in toplevel mode where every
view is directly on the desktop. Nothing easier than that with
KDevelop-2.0! You can even tear tool-views out of their tab window. E.g.
you see that I dragged the documentation browser out of the trees.
Note: Docking back of one view to the main control window means to get
back to "Childframe" mode.
