  file can be used.
  <li>The view mode can be switched between Childframe mode, Toplevel mode and TabPage mode

     advanced MDI for Qt and KDE.

  <li>Project sessions (.kdevses) were introduced.

  added as well as templates for Konqueror plugins and Kicker apps.
  <li>The kde-common/admin copy (admin.tar.gz) has been updated to the latest version in
  KDE CVS. Users of versions prior to 2.0 are advised to update their project's admin
  directory with that to support newer versions of autoconf and automake.
  <li>KDevelop now uses the new tip of day dialog from kdelibs.
  <li>The user manual has been extended to match the new GUI layout plus adds a chapter for
  using Qt Designer with KDevelop projects.

  the switch between .h and .cpp file. It requires ctags-5.0.1.
  <li>The compiler output is shown coloured.
  <li>Man pages are accessable via KDevelop's help browser.

<b>Note:</b> KDevelop-2.0 bases on the source code of the previously released version 1.4.1.
