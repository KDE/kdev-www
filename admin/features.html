<h1>How does this website work</h1>

<p>
The webserver is at the university of Potsdam in Germany (the uni where
Ex-KDeveloper Bernd Gehrmann, Ralf Funken and Sandy Meier came from). Sandy Meier is
still the owner and root user of the website files location, but he's been
99,9% inactive since 2 or 3 years. On demand, he only gives website access
accounts to new KDevelop team members who also want to maintain the website.
Every work on this server is based on unsolicited work.</p>
<p>The website itself is accessed and changed via cvs file management. 
The file structure on the server is the same as the structure in the internet.
The layout is programmed in PHP.</p>
<p>The website is a multi-language one, where English is default. To support a
new different language than English see the <a href="howto.html">howto page</a>.
</p>
<p>Usually, there's one maintainer registered for each language.
The common mechanism for changing the content of a page of www.kdevelop.org
is to first change the English version of the web page file. Next midnight
all registered translators will get an email with a notification about the
changed files with the plea to translate the appropriate language-specific copy.
Now they can cvs-update (or download the file from the <a href="../index.html?filename=website_translation_status.html&amp;set_lang=en">translation status page</a>), translate the changed files and commit back. All
translators also have access to the original English version.
All cvs commits to the website repository will be online with the next ten minutes. A permanently running background process on the webserver always
synchronizes the website with the cvs repository, automatically. As extra feature,
the ChangeLog of the KDevelop source code repository is shown on the main web
page, also synchronized with every full hour.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="../HEAD/doc/api/html/Development.png" alt="KDevelop Teamwork toolchain"></p>
<p>Total redesigns and big changes to the website have
first to be discussed with the other KDevelop developers on the mailing-list,
but usually, it will be suppressed because the current mechanism is so cool
that it must not be changed. :-P</p>

Hope, that helps<br>

<p>During the month of January 2008 the website was converted from HTML 4.01 Transitional to
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/">HTML 4.01 strict</a>
and the content got separated from the presentation which is now exclusively done in
<a href="http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/">CSS</a>.
Tables are no longer used to create the website layout; so it now renders progressively with the main content served before the navigational elements being therefore faster, this also allows people with disabilities to visit our site now.
The new structure is more search-engine friendly, and
<a href="http://www.sitemaps.org/">website maps for search engine robots</a>
are now created daily so the current 1627 unique pages of this site and the 84 unique pages of it's wiki get indexed only when they change, allowing more frequent and precise crawls, at the same time reducing wasted bandwidth (unmodified pages do not get crawled).
The 7841 posts of the
<a href="../phorum5/">forum</a>
are not yet indexed by the search-engines because their information flows into the FAQ, wiki and user-manual pages, and this saves bandwidth.
This website contains 500033 html links, all of them were checked with
<a href="http://linkchecker.sourceforge.net/">linkchecker</a>
and only a few of them (&lt; 100) are broken, mostly links published more that four years ago.</p>

<p>Enjoy,<br>
