# jaxml credits file.

Many thanks to Kragen Sitaker and is invaluable post on comp.lang.python,
which multiplied jaxml speed by approximately 2.2 on the test.py program
launched 5000 times. Speed gain is expected to be even more important on
big xml documents.

Thanks to Jean Jordaan who found a pretty elegant way to solve the namespace
and reserved words problem. See at the end of test/test.py
